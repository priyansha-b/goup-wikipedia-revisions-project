'''Naomi Klein''' (b. May 8, 1970, [[Montreal, Quebec]]) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[journalist]], [[author]] and [[Activism|activist]] known for her political analyses and [[anti-globalisation|criticism of corporate globalization]].

==Family==
Naomi Klein was brought up in a [[Jewish]] family with a history of [[left-wing]] activism. Her parents moved to [[Montreal]], [[Canada]] from the USA in 1967 as [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|war resisters]] to the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://departmentofculture.ca/video-naomi-klein-at-last-nights-town-hall/|title= Video: Naomi Klein at last night’s town hall|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= |date= September 4, 2008 |work= |publisher= DepartmentOfCulture.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her mother, documentary [[film-maker]] [[Bonnie Sherr Klein]], is best known for her [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography]] film ''[[Not a Love Story]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Biography of Bonnie Sherr Klein (*1941): [http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/women/002026-704-e.html Filmmaker, Author, Disability Rights Activist] Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, Michael Klein, is a physician and a member of [[Physicians for Social Responsibility]]. Her brother Seth Klein is director of the [[British Columbia]] office of the [[Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives]]. 

Her paternal grandparents were [[Communist]]s who began to turn against the [[Soviet Union]] after the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] and had abandoned [[Communism]] by 1956. In 1942 her grandfather Phil Klein, an animator at [[Disney]]'s, was fired as an agitator after the [[Disney animators' strike]],&lt;ref&gt;Tom Sito: [http://mag.awn.com/index.php?ltype=Special+Features&amp;category2=&amp;article_no=2562&amp;page=1The Disney Strike of 1941: How It Changed Animation &amp; Comics] Animation World Magazine, July 19, 2005, retrieved on March 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and went to work at a shipyard instead. Klein's father grew up surrounded by ideas of social justice and racial equality, but found it "difficult and frightening to be the child of Communists", a so-called [[red diaper baby]].&lt;ref name="nyer"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/12/08/081208fa_fact_macfarquhar?currentPage=all|title= Outside Agitator: Naomi Klein and the New Left|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= Larissa MacFarquhar|date= December 8, 2008|work= |publisher= [[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Klein's husband, [[Avi Lewis]], comes from a similar leftist background. He is a TV journalist and documentary filmmaker. His parents are the writer and activist [[Michele Landsberg]] and politician and diplomat [[Stephen Lewis]], son of [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]], one of the founders of the Canadian [[New Democratic Party]], son in turn of [[Moishe Lewis]], born Losz, a Jewish labour activist of "[[Jewish Labour Bund|the Bund]]" who left [[Eastern Europe]] for Canada in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Extended story by Avi Lewis: [http://www.cbc.ca/whodoyouthinkyouare/stories/ext_avi.php Who do you think you are?] CBC television&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein and her husband live in [[Toronto]]. 

==Early life==
Klein spent her teenage years as a [[shopping mall|mall]] rat, obsessed by designer logos.&lt;ref name= "Hand to Brand"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.commondreams.org/views/092300-103.htm|title= Hand-To-Brand-Combat: A Profile Of Naomi Klein|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= Katharine Viner|date= September 23, 2000|work= |publisher= [[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child and teenager, she found it "very oppressive to have a very public feminist mother" and she rejected politics, instead embracing "full-on [[consumerism]]". She credits two crises with changing her outlook. First of all, when she was 17 and preparing for the [[University of Toronto]], her mother had a stroke and became severely disabled.&lt;ref name= "abilities"&gt;

{{cite web |url= http://www.enablelink.org/include/article.php?pid=&amp;cid=&amp;subid=&amp;aid=673|title= We are Who You are:Feminism and Disability|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= Bonnie Sherr Klein|date= Spring 1993|work= Abilities|publisher= Enablelink.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naomi, along with her father and brother, took care of Bonnie through the period in hospital and at home, making educational sacrifices to do so.&lt;ref name= "abilities"/&gt; That year off stopped her "from being such a brat".&lt;ref name= "Hand to Brand"/&gt;

She made it the next year to the [[University of Toronto], when the second event unfolded. The 1989 [[École Polytechnique massacre]] of female engineering students proved her wake-up call to [[feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigthink.com/policy-politics/6340|title=Naomi Klein: The Montreal Massacre|publisher=Bigthink.com |accessdate=2008-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Hand to Brand"/&gt;

Klein's writing career started with contributions to ''[[The Varsity (newspaper)|The Varsity]]'', a student newspaper, where she served as editor-in-chief.  After her third year at the U of T, she dropped out of university to take a job at the ''[[Toronto Globe and Mail]]'', followed by an editorship at ''[[This Magazine]]'', the Canadian equivalent of the US-american ''[[The Nation]]''.&lt;ref name="nyer"/&gt;

==Career in journalism==
====No Logo====
{{main|No Logo}}
In 2000, Klein published the book ''[[No Logo]]'', which for many became a [[manifesto]] of the [[anti-globalization|anti-corporate globalization movement]]. In it, she attacks [[brand name|brand]]-oriented [[consumer culture]] by describing the operations of large [[corporation]]s. She also accuses several such corporations of unethically exploiting workers in the world's poorest countries in pursuit of greater profits. In this book, Klein criticized [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] so severely that Nike published a point-by-point response to perceived inaccuracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010618162615/http://nikebiz.com/labor/nologo_let.shtml  |archivedate=2001-06-18 |url=http://nikebiz.com/labor/nologo_let.shtml |title=Nike's response to ''No Logo'' |date=2000-03-08 |publisher=[[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''No Logo'' became an international bestseller, selling over one million copies in over 28 languages.&lt;ref name="''The Nation'' bio"&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/directory/bios/naomi_klein The Nation | Unconventional Wisdom Since 1865&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fences and Windows====
{{main|Fences and Windows}}
In 2002 Klein published ''[[Fences and Windows]]'', a collection of her articles and speeches written on behalf of the anti-globalization movement (all proceeds from the book go to benefit activist organizations through The Fences and Windows Fund). Klein also contributes to ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', ''[[In These Times]]'', ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', ''[[This Magazine]]'', and ''[[The Guardian]]''.

====Iraq war criticism====
Klein has written on various current issues, such as the [[Iraq War]]. In a September 2004 article for ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harpers.org/BaghdadYearZero.html |title=Baghdad year zero: Pillaging Iraq in pursuit of a neocon utopia |author= Naomi Klein|year= 2004 |month= September |work= [[Harper's Magazine]] |publisher=The Harper's Magazine Foundation |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; she argues that, contrary to popular belief, the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] did have a clear plan for post-invasion Iraq, which was to build a completely unconstrained [[free market economics|free market economy]]. She describes plans to allow foreigners to extract wealth from Iraq, and the methods used to achieve those goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last= Klein|first= Naomi |subjectlink= Naomi Klein |interviewer= [[Amy Goodman]] |program= [[Democracy Now!]] |callsign= [[Pacifica Radio]]|city= |date= 2004-10-13 |accessdate= 2009-02-17| url= http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=04/10/13/144220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last= Klein|first= Naomi|subjectlink= Naomi Klein|interviewer= |title= The Persuaders: Interview Naomi Klein|callsign = [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|city= |date= January 22, 2004|program= PBS Frontline|accessdate= 2009-02-17|url= http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/persuaders/interviews/klein.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 film ''[[War, Inc.]]'' was partially inspired by her article, ''Baghdad Year Zero''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,2159038,00.html|title= I'm basically a brand (article about John Cusack's career)|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= Ryan Gilbey|date= August 31, 2007|work= |publisher= [[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Take====
{{main|The Take}}
In 2004, Klein and her husband, [[Avi Lewis]], released a [[documentary film]] called ''[[The Take (2004 film)|The Take]]'' about factory workers in [[Argentina]] who [[recovered factory|took over a closed plant]] and resumed production, operating as a [[collective]].&lt;br /&gt; 
The first African screening was in the Kennedy Road shack settlement in the South African city of [[Durban]], where the [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] movement began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nplusonemag.com/klein.html|title= Seattle to Baghdad|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= Kim Phillips-Fein|date= May 10, 2005|work= |publisher= [[n+1]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Shock Doctrine====
{{main|The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism}}
Klein's third book, ''The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism'', was published on September 4, 2007, becoming an international and [[New York Times bestseller]]&lt;ref name="''The Nation'' bio"/&gt; translated into 20 languages.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url= http://www.randomhouse.ca/author/results.pperl?authorid=15909|title= Author Spotlight: Naomi Klein|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= |date= |work= |publisher= RandomHouse.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book argues that the free market policies of Nobel Laureate [[Milton Friedman]] and the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School of Economics]] have risen to prominence in countries such as [[Chile under Pinochet]], [[Economy of Russia|Russia under Yeltsin]] and the United States. The book also argues that policy initiatives such as the privatization of Iraq's economy under the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] were pushed through while the citizens of these countries were in shock from disasters or upheavals. It is also claimed that these shocks are in some cases, such as the [[Falklands War]], created with the intention of being able to push through these unpopular reforms in the wake of the crisis.

''The Shock Doctrine'' was adapted into a [[short film]] of the same name, released onto [[YouTube]]. The film was directed by Jonás Cuarón, produced and co-written by his father [[Alfonso Cuarón]]. The video has been viewed over one million times.&lt;ref name="''The Nation'' bio"/&gt;

The publication of the book took her career and public profile to new highs on both sides of the Atlantic, with the ''[[New Yorker]]'' judging her "the most visible and influential figure on the American left — what [[Howard Zinn]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] were thirty years ago." On February 24, 2009, the book was awarded the inaugural [[Warwick Prize for Writing]] from the [[University of Warwick]] in England. The prize carried a cash award of £50,000.

==Other activities==
Klein once lectured as a Miliband Fellow at the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/miliband/visitingTeachingFellows.htm |title=Visiting teaching fellows |publisher=London School of Economics and Political Science |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein was the keynote speaker at the first national conference of the [[Alliance of Concerned Jewish Canadians]]. In light of the [[2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict|Israeli bombing of Gaza]] in January 2009, Klein made the case for a boycott of Israel to bring about the "end of the occupation", in line with the [[anti-apartheid|mass movement against]] South African [[apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;''Guardian'' 10 January 2009 &lt;/ref&gt;

Klein ranked 11th in an internet poll&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Global public intellectuals poll | url= http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=7078 |work= Prospect Magazine |publisher= Prospect Publishing Limited |year= 2005 |month= November |first= David |last= Herman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.alternet.org/story/21099/|title= What Are We Fighting For?|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= Lakshmi Chaudhry|date= January 27, 2005|work= |publisher= AlterNet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

She was the highest ranked woman on the list.

==Criticism==
Klein has been criticized by ''[[The Economist]]'', which claims Klein ignores the good capitalism does in the world and holds naive or nebulous ideas for alternatives.&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/people/displaystory.cfm?story_id=1429429 Why Naomi Klein needs to grow up] - [[The Economist]], November 7, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Johan Norberg]] has criticized what he described as flaws in ''The Shock Doctrine''.  He pointed out instances in which he believes Klein has distorted history and he criticized the book for what he said was a misleading presentation of Milton Friedman's views and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=9384|title= The Klein Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Polemics|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= Johan Norberg|date= May 14, 2008|work= |publisher= [[Cato Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reviewing the book, [[Jonathan Chait]] (senior editor of the ''The New Republic'') criticized Klein for employing "an extremely crude sort of Marxist economicism," ignoring facts that contradicted her thesis, and "pay[ing] shockingly (but, given her premises, unsurprisingly) little attention to right-wing ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tnr.com/story_print.html?id=69067f1c-d089-474b-a8a0-945d1deb420b|title= Dead Left|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= Jonathan Chait|date= July 30, 2008|work= |publisher= The New Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Klein responded to some of these criticisms on her web site.

Klein has responded to Norberg's and Chait's criticism, claiming they make [[straw man]] arguments about her positions and noting that such criticisms have been overly personal. She wrote: 'Again and again, readers of ''The New Republic'' are left with the distinct impression that ''The Shock Doctrine'' is a work of opinion journalism, rather than a thesis based on research and reporting.'&lt;ref name= "NaomiKlein.org"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.naomiklein.org/articles/2008/09/response-attacks|title= One Year After the Publication of The Shock Doctrine, A Response to the Attacks|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= Naomi Klein|date= September 2nd, 2008|work= |publisher= NaomiKlein.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Norberg has subsequently responded to Klein's defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=9626|title= Three Days After Klein's Response, Another Attack|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= Johan Norberg|date= September 4, 2008|work= |publisher= [[Cato Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein has also been criticised from the left. She was criticized in ''[[Z Communications]]'' for her portrayal of [[Peron]] in her documentary film ''[[The Take (2004 film)|The Take]]'', which they felt made him appear to be a social democrat.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url= http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/7824|title= The Take|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= Daniel Morduchowicz  |date= September 20, 2004 |work= |publisher=Z Space}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, her August 2004 Nation column 'Bring Najaf to New York' was cited by several prominent liberal opinion makers as an example of left minded people making excuses for far right movements. Klein argued that [[Muqtada Al Sadr]]'s [[Mahdi Army]] "represents the overwhelmingly mainstream sentiment in Iraq."&lt;ref name= "The Nation"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thenation.com/doc/20040913/klein|title= Bring Najaf to New York|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= Naomi Klein|date= August 26, 2004|work= |publisher= [[The Nation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to say "Yes, if elected Sadr would try to turn Iraq into a theocracy like Iran, but for now his demands are for direct elections and an end to foreign occupation".&lt;ref name= "The Nation"/&gt;

[[Christopher Hitchens]], a former ''Nation'' columnist, responded, calling her position on the Iraq War "reactionary" and arguing that Klein, along with [[Tariq Ali]] and [[Michael Moore]] were "fellow travelers with [[fascism]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.slate.com/id/2106324/|title= Murder by Any Other Name: The rest of the world may be tiring of jihad, but The Nation isn't|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= Christopher Hitchens|date= September 7, 2004|work= |publisher= [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as he alleges that Ali had called for 'solidarity' with the insurgency, and Moore had compared Iraqi insurgents to the [[Minutemen]]). [[Marc Cooper]], also a former ''Nation'' columnist, attacked the assertion that Al Sadr represented mainstream Iraqi sentiment and that American forces had brought the fight to the holy city of Najaf.&lt;ref name = "MarcCooper"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://marccooper.typepad.com/marccooper/2004/08/najaf_to_new_yo.html|title= Najaf to New York? Better: New York to Najaf.|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= Marc Cooper|date= August 27, 2004|work= |publisher= Self published blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote "Klein should know better. All enemies of the U.S. occupation she opposes are not her friends. Or ours. Or those of the Iraqi people. I don’t think that Mullah Al Sadr, in any case, is much desirous of support issuing from secular Jewish feminist-socialists."&lt;ref name = "MarcCooper"/&gt; [[Norman Geras]] wrote on his blog, "Klein's willing to cut him [Al Sadr] some slack. He's only a theocrat, after all, who wants to turn Iraq into a [[theocracy]] like [[Iran]]; he's not of the Republican Party".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://normblog.typepad.com/normblog/2004/08/the_state_of_na.html|title= The state of Naomi Klein|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= Norman Geras|date= August 27, 2004|work= |publisher= Self published blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;
