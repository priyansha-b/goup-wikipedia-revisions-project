'''Naomi Klein''' (born May 8, 1970) is a Canadian author and [[Activism|social activist]] known for her political analyses and [[alter-globalisation|criticism of corporate globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=10110 |title=The Shock Doctrine |first=Chris |last=Nineham |date=October 2007 |accessdate=April 25, 2011 |work=[[Socialist Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Klein was born in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], and brought up in a [[Jew]]ish family with a history of peace activism. Her parents had moved to Montreal from the U.S. in 1967 as [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|war resisters]] to the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="doc_townhall"/&gt;  Her mother, [[documentary]] [[film-maker]] [[Bonnie Sherr Klein]], is best known for her [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography]] film ''[[Not a Love Story]]''.&lt;ref name="bonnie_sherr_klein_bio" /&gt; Her father, Michael Klein, is a physician and a member of [[Physicians for Social Responsibility]]. Her brother, Seth Klein, is director of the [[British Columbia]] office of the [[Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives]].

Her paternal grandparents were communists who began to turn against the Soviet Union after the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] and had abandoned [[communism]] by 1956. In 1942 her grandfather Phil Klein, an animator at [[Disney]], was fired after the [[Disney animators' strike]],&lt;ref name="tom_sito_disney"/&gt; and went to work at a shipyard instead. Klein's father grew up surrounded by ideas of [[social justice]] and [[racial equality]], but found it "difficult and frightening to be the child of Communists", a so-called [[red diaper baby]].&lt;ref name="nyer"/&gt;

Klein's husband, [[Avi Lewis]], works as a TV journalist and documentary filmmaker. His parents are the writer and activist [[Michele Landsberg]] and politician and diplomat [[Stephen Lewis]], son of [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]], one of the founders of the Canadian [[New Democratic Party]], son in turn of [[Moishe Lewis]], born Losz, a Jewish labour activist of "[[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|the Bund]]" who left [[Central Europe]] for Canada in 1921.&lt;ref name="avi_lewis_cbc"/&gt;  The couple's first child, son Toma, was born on June 13, 2012.&lt;ref name="Naomi Klein Facebook Page"/&gt;

==Early life==
Klein spent much of her teenage years in [[shopping mall]]s, obsessed with [[designer label]]s.&lt;ref name="Hand-to-Brand"/&gt; As a child and teenager, she found it "very oppressive to have a very public feminist mother" and she rejected politics, instead embracing "full-on [[consumerism]]."

She has attributed her change in worldview to two events. One was when she was 17 and preparing for the [[University of Toronto]], her mother had a stroke and became severely disabled.&lt;ref name="abilities"/&gt; Naomi, her father and brother took care of Bonnie through the period in hospital and at home, making educational sacrifices to do so.&lt;ref name="abilities"/&gt; That year off prevented her "from being such a brat."&lt;ref name="Hand-to-Brand"/&gt;  The next year, after beginning her studies at the [[University of Toronto]], the second event occurred: the 1989 [[École Polytechnique massacre]] of female engineering students, which proved to be a wake-up call to [[feminism]].&lt;ref name="montreal-massacre"/&gt;

Klein's writing career started with contributions to ''[[The Varsity (newspaper)|The Varsity]]'', a student newspaper, where she served as editor-in-chief.  After her third year at the University of Toronto, she dropped out of university to take a job at the ''[[Toronto Globe and Mail]]'', followed by an editorship at ''[[This Magazine]].'' In 1995, she returned to the University of Toronto with the intention of finishing her degree&lt;ref name="nyer"/&gt; but left the university for a journalism internship before acquiring the final credits required to complete her degree.&lt;ref&gt;Q&amp;A Interview with Brian Lamb, on CSPAN, dated November 29, 2009, [http://www.q-and-a.org/Program/index.asp?ProgramID=1260 Klein Q&amp;A interview and transcript]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major works==
===''No Logo''===

{{Main|No Logo}}
In 2000, Klein published the book ''[[No Logo]]'', which for many became a [[manifesto]] of the [[alter-globalization|anti-corporate globalization movement]]. In it, she attacks [[brand name|brand]]-oriented [[consumer culture]] and the operations of large [[corporation]]s. She also accuses several such corporations of unethically exploiting workers in the world's poorest countries in pursuit of greater profits. In this book, Klein criticized [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] so severely that Nike published a point-by-point response.&lt;ref name="no-logo-nike"/&gt; ''No Logo'' became an international bestseller, selling over one million copies in over 28 languages.&lt;ref name="Nation-bio"/&gt;

===''Fences and Windows''===

{{Main|Fences and Windows}}
In 2002 Klein published ''[[Fences and Windows]]'', a collection of her articles and speeches written on behalf of the [[alter-globalization]] movement (all proceeds from the book go to benefit activist organizations through The Fences and Windows Fund).

===''The Take''===

{{Main|The Take (2004 film)}}
In 2004, Klein and her husband, [[Avi Lewis]], released a [[documentary film]] called ''[[The Take (2004 film)|The Take]]'' about factory workers in [[Argentina]] who [[recovered factory|took over a closed plant]] and resumed production, operating as a [[collective]]. The first African screening was in the Kennedy Road shack settlement in the South African city of [[Durban]], where the [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] movement began.&lt;ref name="Phillips-Fein"/&gt;

At least one article in ''[[Z Communications]]'' criticized ''The Take'' for its portrayal of the Argentine General and politician [[Juan Domingo Perón]], which they felt portrayed him as a social democrat.&lt;ref name="the_take"/&gt;

===''The Shock Doctrine''===

{{Main|The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism}}
Klein's third book, ''The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism'', was published on September 4, 2007, becoming an international and [[New York Times bestseller]]&lt;ref name="Nation-bio"/&gt; translated into 28 languages.&lt;ref name="RandomHouse"/&gt;  The book argues that the free market policies of Nobel Laureate [[Milton Friedman]] and the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School of Economics]] have risen to prominence in countries such as [[Chile under Pinochet]], [[Economy of Russia|Russia under Yeltsin]], and the United States (for example, the privatization of the [[New Orleans Public Schools]] after [[Hurricane Katrina]]). The book also argues that policy initiatives (for instance, the privatization of Iraq's economy under the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]]) were rushed through while the citizens of these countries were in shock from disasters, upheavals, or invasion. 

Central to the book's thesis is the contention that those who wish to implement unpopular [[free market]] policies now routinely do so by taking advantage of certain features of the aftermath of major disasters, be they economic, political, military or natural in nature. The suggestion is that when a society experiences a major 'shock' there is a widespread desire for a rapid and decisive response to correct the situation; this desire for bold and immediate action provides an opportunity for unscrupulous actors to implement policies which go far beyond a legitimate response to disaster. The book suggests that when the rush to act means the specifics of a response will go unscrutinized, that is the moment when unpopular and unrelated policies will intentionally be rushed into effect. The book appears to claim that these shocks are in some cases, such as the [[Falklands War]], intentionally encouraged or even manufactured.  

Klein identifies the "shock doctrine", elaborating on [[Joseph Schumpeter]], as the latest in capitalism's phases of "creative destruction".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/cockburn09222007.html|title=On Naomi Klein's "The Shock Doctrine"|publisher=[[CounterPunch]]|first=Alexander |last=Cockburn|date=September 22 / 23, 2007|authorlink=Alexander Cockburn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Shock Doctrine'' was adapted into a [[short film]] of the same name, released onto [[YouTube]]. The film was directed by [[Jonás Cuarón]], produced and co-written by his father [[Alfonso Cuarón]]. The video has been viewed over one million times.&lt;ref name="Nation-bio"/&gt;

The publication of ''The Shock Doctrine'' increased Klein's prominence, with the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' judging her "the most visible and influential figure on the American left—what [[Howard Zinn]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] were thirty years ago." On February 24, 2009, the book was awarded the inaugural [[Warwick Prize for Writing]] from the [[University of Warwick]] in England. The prize carried a cash award of £50,000.

==Iraq War criticism==

Klein has written on various current issues, such as the [[Iraq War]]. In a September 2004 article for ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'',&lt;ref name="Harpers"/&gt; she argues that, contrary to popular belief, the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] did have a clear plan for post-invasion Iraq, which was to build a completely unconstrained [[free market economics|free market economy]]. She describes plans to allow foreigners to extract wealth from Iraq, and the methods used to achieve those goals.&lt;ref name="Democracy-Now"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt; The 2008 film ''[[War, Inc.]]'' was partially inspired by her article, ''Baghdad Year Zero''.&lt;ref name="film.guardian"/&gt;

Klein's August 2004 "Bring Najaf to New York", published in ''The Nation'', argued that [[Muqtada Al Sadr]]'s [[Mahdi Army]] "represents the overwhelmingly mainstream sentiment in Iraq."&lt;ref name="Najif-Nation"/&gt; She went on to say "Yes, if elected Sadr would try to turn Iraq into a theocracy like Iran, but for now his demands are for direct elections and an end to foreign occupation".&lt;ref name="Najif-Nation"/&gt; [[Marc Cooper]], a former ''Nation'' columnist, attacked the assertion that Al Sadr represented mainstream Iraqi sentiment and that American forces had brought the fight to the holy city of Najaf.&lt;ref name="MarcCooper"/&gt; Cooper wrote that "Klein should know better. All enemies of the U.S. occupation she opposes are not her friends. Or ours. Or those of the Iraqi people. I don’t think that Mullah Al Sadr, in any case, is much desirous of support issuing from secular Jewish feminist-socialists."&lt;ref name = "MarcCooper"/&gt;

==Criticism of Israeli policies==

In March 2008, Klein was the keynote speaker at the first national conference of the [[Independent Jewish Voices (Canada)|Alliance of Concerned Jewish Canadians]].  In January 2009, during the [[Gaza War]], Klein supported the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] (BDS) campaign against [[Israel]], arguing that "the best strategy to end the increasingly bloody occupation is for Israel to become the target of the kind of global movement that put an end to apartheid in South Africa."&lt;ref name="time-for-boycott"/&gt;

In summer 2009, on the occasion of the publication of the [[Hebrew]] translation of her book ''The Shock Doctrine'', Klein visited Israel, the [[West Bank]], and [[Gaza]], combining the promotion of her book and the BDS campaign. In an interview to the Israeli newspaper ''[[Ha'aretz]]'' she emphasized that it is important to her "not to boycott Israelis but rather to boycott the normalization of Israel and the conflict."&lt;ref name="klein_haaretz"/&gt; In a speech in [[Ramallah]] on 27 June, she apologized to the [[Palestinians]] for not joining the BDS campaign earlier.&lt;ref name="klein_ramallah"/&gt; Her remarks, particularly that "[Some Jews] even think we get one get-away-with-genocide-free-card" were characterized by an op-ed columnist in the ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' as "violent" and "unethical", and as the "most perverse of aspersions on Jews, an age-old stereotype of Jews as intrinsically evil and malicious."&lt;ref name="schimmel"/&gt;

Klein was also a spokesperson for the protest against the [[2009 Toronto International Film Festival#Controversy over Tel Aviv spotlight|spotlight on Tel Aviv]] at the [[2009 Toronto International Film Festival]], a spotlight that Klein said was a very selective and misleading portrait of Israel.&lt;ref name="globe_and_mail"/&gt;

==Environmentalism==

In recent years Klein’s attention has turned to environmentalism, with particular focus on [[climate change]], about which she is currently writing a book.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.democracynow.org/2011/3/9/my_fear_is_that_climate_change&lt;/ref&gt; 

She has encouraged the [[Occupy movement]] to join forces with the environmental movement, saying the financial crisis and the climate crisis have the same root – unrestrained corporate greed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJ8CoxnjjZg&lt;/ref&gt; She gave a speech to Occupy Wall Street where she described the world as ‘upside down’, where we act as if ‘there is no end to what is actually finite—fossil fuels and the atmospheric space to absorb their emissions’, and as if there are ‘limits to what is actually bountiful—the financial resources to build the kind of society we need.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenation.com/article/163844/occupy-wall-street-most-important-thing-world-now#&lt;/ref&gt;

She has been a particularly vocal critic of the [[Alberta Oil Sands]], describing it in a TED talk as a form of ‘terrestrial skinning’.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/naomi_klein_addicted_to_risk.html&lt;/ref&gt; On September 2nd, she attended the demonstration against the [[Keystone XL]] pipeline outside the White House and was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2011/09/02/world-naomi-klein-arrested-at-white-house-keystone-pipeline-protest.html&lt;/ref&gt; Klein celebrated Obama’s decision to postpone a decision on Keystone pipeline until 2013 pending an environmental review as a victory for the environmental movement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJ8CoxnjjZg&lt;/ref&gt;  

She attended the [[COP15]] summit of 2009. She put the blame for the failure of COP15 on Barack Obama&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/dec/21/copenhagen-failure-obama-climate-change&lt;/ref&gt;, and described her own country, Canada, as a ‘climate criminal’.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO9G1r2aBEo&amp;feature=relmfu}}&lt;/ref&gt; She presented the Angry Mermaid Award (a satirical award designed to recognise the corporations who have best sabotaged the climate negotiations) to [[Monsanto]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge864JnnVm0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other activities==
Klein contributes to ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', ''[[In These Times]]'', ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', ''[[This Magazine]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', and ''[[The Guardian]]''.

She once lectured as a Miliband Fellow at the [[London School of Economics]] as an award-winning journalist, writer on the anti-globalisation movement.&lt;ref name="lse"/&gt;

She ranked 11th in an internet poll of the [[The 2005 Global Intellectuals Poll|top global intellectuals of 2005]], a list of the world's top 100 public intellectuals compiled by the ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]'' magazine in conjunction with ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="globe_poll"/&gt;

She was involved in a protest condemning police action during the G20 summit in Toronto, ON. She spoke to a rally seeking the release of protesters in front of police headquarters on June 28, 2010.&lt;ref name="Rabble"/&gt;

In May 2011, Klein received an honourary degree from [[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)|Saint Thomas University]].

On October 6, 2011, she visited [[Occupy Wall Street]] and gave a speech declaring the protest movement "the most important thing in the world". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Klein |first=Naomi |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/163844/occupy-wall-street-most-important-thing-world-now |title=Occupy Wall Street: The Most Important Thing in the World Now |newspaper=The Nation |date=October 6, 2011 |accessdate=March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 10, 2011, she participated in a panel discussion about the future of [[Occupy Wall Street]] with four other panelists, including [[Michael Moore]], [[William Greider]], and [[Rinku Sen]], in which she stressed the crucial nature of the evolving movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/video/164494/watch-michael-moore-naomi-klein-and-others-owss-possibilities |title=Michael Moore, Naomi Klein and Others on What's Next for OWS |publisher=The Nation |date=November 9, 2011 |accessdate=March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
