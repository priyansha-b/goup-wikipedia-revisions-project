'''Greta Thunberg'''{{efn| {{IPA-sv|²ɡreːta ²tʉːnbærj|lang|Sv-Greta Thunberg.ogg}}.}} {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|FRSGS}} (born 3 January 2003) is a Swedish teenage [[Environmental movement|environmental activist]] on [[climate change]] whose campaigning has gained international recognition.

Thunberg first became known for her [[youth activism|activism]] in August 2018 when, at age 15, she began spending her school days outside the [[Swedish parliament]] to call for stronger [[Climate change mitigation|action on global warming]] by holding up a sign saying (in Swedish) "School strike for climate".  Soon, other students engaged in similar protests in their own communities. Together they organised a [[school climate strike]] movement under the name Fridays for Future.&lt;!-- EDITORS on the Eng Wiki Fridays for Future is a redirect back to our article "School climate strike" --&gt; After Thunberg addressed the [[2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference]], student strikes took place every week somewhere in the world. In 2019, there were at least two coordinated multi-city protests involving over one million students each.&lt;ref name="WEB-HPR(2019-03-19)"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://harvardpolitics.com/united-states/youth-demand-climate-action-in-global-school-strike/ |title=Youth Demand Climate Action in Global School Strike |last=Cohen |first=Ilana |last2=Heberle |first2=Jacob |date=19 March 2019 |website=[[Harvard Political Review]] |language=en |access-date=30 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190705183307/http://harvardpolitics.com/united-states/youth-demand-climate-action-in-global-school-strike/ |archive-date=5 July 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NEWS-Time(2019-05-24)"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://time.com/5595365/global-climate-strikes-greta-thunberg/ |title=Students From 1,600 Cities Just Walked Out of School to Protest Climate Change.

Thunberg says she first heard about climate change in 2011, when she was 8 years old, and could not understand why so little was being done about it.&lt;ref name="YouTube-Thunberg(2018-11-24)"&gt;{{cite AV media |first=Greta |last=Thunberg |date=24 November 2018 |title=School strike for climate – save the world by changing the rules |publisher=TEDxStockholm |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAmmUIEsN9A&amp;t=1m46s |access-date=29 January 2019 |time=1:46 |via=[[YouTube]] |quote=I was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, OCD, and selective mutism.

For about two years, Thunberg challenged her parents to lower the family's [[carbon footprint]] by becoming [[Veganism#Environmental veganism|vegan]] and [[Environmental impact of aviation|giving up flying]], which in part meant her mother had to give up her international career as an opera singer.&lt;ref name="Democracy Now"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Thunberg credits her parents' eventual response and lifestyle changes with giving her hope and belief that she could make a difference.&lt;ref name="Democracy Now" /&gt; The family story is recounted in the 2018 book ''[[Scenes from the Heart]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://livewire.thewire.in/politics/greta-thunberg-film-childhood8491/|title='Scenes From the Heart': Backstory of 16-Year-Old Climate Activist Greta Thunberg|date=6 May 2019|access-date=31 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190701174347/https://livewire.thewire.in/politics/greta-thunberg-film-childhood8491/|archive-date=1 July 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2018, Thunberg began the school climate strikes and public speeches for which she has become an internationally recognised [[climate activist]].  Her father does not like her missing school, but said: "[We] respect that she wants to make a stand. She can either sit at home and be really unhappy, or protest, and be happy".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/sep/01/swedish-15-year-old-cutting-class-to-fight-the-climate-crisis |title=The Swedish 15-year-old who's cutting class to fight the climate crisis |last=Crouch |first=David |date=1 September 2018 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=12 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190104073409/https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/sep/01/swedish-15-year-old-cutting-class-to-fight-the-climate-crisis |archive-date=4 January 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunberg says her teachers are divided in their views about her missing class to make her point. She says: "As people they think what I am doing is good, but as teachers they say I should stop."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;
In July 2019, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reported "Thunberg is now taking a sabbatical year from school, and is hoping to meet with people on the front line of the climate change movement during her trip to North America, which will include visits to Canada, Mexico and Chile."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/5637506/greta-thunberg-atlantic-americas-trip/|title=Climate Activist Greta Thunberg to Set Sail for the Americas|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2019-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of her first speeches demanding climate action, Thunberg described the selective mutism aspect of her condition as meaning she "only speaks when necessary".&lt;ref name="YouTube-Thunberg(2018-11-24)"/&gt; In 2019, Thunberg also contributed a [[voiceover]] for a release of [[The 1975 (2019 song)|"The 1975"]], the theme song of an [[The 1975|English band by the same name]]. Thunberg finishes by urging: "So, everyone out there, it is now time for civil disobedience. It is time to rebel."

In an interview with [[Amy Goodman]] from ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', Thunberg said she first got the idea of a climate strike after [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting|school shootings in the United States in February 2018]] led to several youths refusing to go back to school.&lt;ref name="Democracy Now"&gt;{{cite interview |url=https://www.democracynow.org/2018/12/11/meet_the_15_year_old_swedish |title=School Strike for Climate: Meet 15-Year-Old Activist Greta Thunberg, Who Inspired a Global Movement |last=Thunberg |first=Greta |interviewer=[[Amy Goodman]] |website=[[Democracy Now!]] |date=11 December 2018 |accessdate=22 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190717102212/https://www.democracynow.org/2018/12/11/meet_the_15_year_old_swedish |archive-date=17 July 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; These teen activists at [[Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School]] in [[Parkland, Florida]], went on to organise the [[March for Our Lives]] in support of greater [[gun control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|title=Teen activist on climate change: If we don't do anything right now, we're screwed|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGmBkIUwYkA|last=Thunberg|first=Greta|interviewer=[[Fareed Zakaria]]|agency=[[CNN]]|via=YouTube|date=23 December 2018|access-date=10 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190315172703/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGmBkIUwYkA|archive-date=15 March 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Guardian view on teenage activists: protesters not puppets |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/07/the-guardian-view-on-teenage-activists-look-whos-pulling-the-strings |access-date=11 February 2019 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=7 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190211043029/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/07/the-guardian-view-on-teenage-activists-look-whos-pulling-the-strings |archive-date=11 February 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, Thunberg won a climate change essay competition held by Swedish newspaper ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]''. In part, she wrote that "I want to feel safe. How can I feel safe when I know we are in the greatest crisis in human history?”&lt;ref name="NEWS-Wired(6-6-2019)" /&gt; The paper published her article after which she was contacted by Bo Thorén from Fossil Free Dalsland, a group interested in doing something about climate change. Thunberg attended a few of their meetings, and at one of them, Thorén also suggested that school children could strike for climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.goodthingsguy.com/opinion/greta-thunberg/ |title=Greta Thunberg: School strike for climate and to save the world! |date=5 May 2019 |website=Good Things Guy |access-date=12 May 2019|last=Lindeque|first=Brent }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunberg tried to persuade other young people to get involved but "no one was really interested" so eventually, she decided to go ahead with the strike by herself.&lt;ref name="Democracy Now"/&gt;

On 20 August 2018, Thunberg, who had just started ninth grade, decided not to attend school until the [[2018 Swedish general election]] on 9 September; her protest began after the [[2018 European heat wave|heat waves]] and [[2018 Sweden wildfires|wildfires]] during Sweden's hottest summer in at least 262 years.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Her demands were that the Swedish government reduce carbon emissions in accordance with the [[Paris Agreement]], and she protested by sitting outside the [[Riksdag]] every day for three weeks during school hours with the sign ''Skolstrejk för klimatet'' (school strike for the climate).&lt;ref name="Newyorker1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-fifteen-year-old-climate-activist-who-is-demanding-a-new-kind-of-politics |title=The Fifteen-Year-Old Climate Activist Who Is Demanding a New Kind of Politics |date=2 October 2018 |newspaper=[[The New Yorker]] |last=Gessen |first=Masha |authorlink=Masha Gessen |accessdate=22 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190105223945/https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-fifteen-year-old-climate-activist-who-is-demanding-a-new-kind-of-politics |archive-date=5 January 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; She also handed out leaflets that stated: "I am doing this because you adults are shitting on my future."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Thunberg posted her original strike photo on Instagram and Twitter, and other social media accounts quickly took up her cause.&lt;ref name="wired.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.wired.co.uk/article/greta-thunberg-climate-crisis Greta Thunberg: How one teenager became the voice of the planet,] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190823154313/https://www.wired.co.uk/article/greta-thunberg-climate-crisis |date=23 August 2019 }} Wired, August 2019&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ingmar Rentzhog, founder of a Swedish climate-focused social media company, ''We Don't Have Time'' (WDHT), her strike began attracting public attention after he turned up with a freelance photographer and then posted Thunberg's photograph on his Facebook page and [[Instagram]] account. He also made a video in English that he posted on the company's [[YouTube]] channel that had almost 88,000 views.&lt;ref name="TheLocal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thelocal.se/20190209/start-up-used-child-climate-activist-to-raise-millions |title=Start-up used teen climate activist to raise millions: Swedish paper |newspaper=[[The Local]] |date=9 February 2019 |accessdate=22 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727001257/https://www.thelocal.se/20190209/start-up-used-child-climate-activist-to-raise-millions |archive-date=27 July 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; A representative of the Finnish bank, Nordea, quoted one of Thunberg's tweets to more than 200,000 followers. Thunberg's social media profile attracted local reporters whose stories earned international coverage in little more than a week.&lt;ref name="wired.co.uk"/&gt;

After the general elections, Thunberg continued to strike only on Fridays. She inspired school students across the globe to take part in student strikes.&lt;ref name="Guardian2"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Damian |last=Carrington |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/04/leaders-like-children-school-strike-founder-greta-thunberg-tells-un-climate-summit |title='Our leaders are like children', school strike founder tells climate summit |date=4 December 2018 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=22 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190102050002/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/04/leaders-like-children-school-strike-founder-greta-thunberg-tells-un-climate-summit |archive-date=2 January 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2018, more than 20,000 students had held strikes in at least 270 cities.&lt;ref name="Guardian2"/&gt;

After October 2018, Thunberg's activism evolved from solitary protesting to taking part in demonstrations throughout Europe; making several high-profile public speeches, and mobilising her growing number of followers on [[social media]] platforms. By March 2019, she was still staging her regular protests outside the Swedish parliament every Friday, where other students now occasionally join her. Her activism has not interfered with her schoolwork, but she has had less spare time.&lt;ref name="jw01"/&gt;

=== 2019 visit to the Americas ===
{{Further|Voyage of Greta Thunberg}}

In August 2019, Thunberg sailed across the Atlantic Ocean from Plymouth, UK, to New York, US, in a 60&amp;nbsp;ft racing yacht equipped with solar panels and underwater turbines. The trip was announced as a carbon-neutral transatlantic crossing serving as a demonstration of Thunberg's declared beliefs of the importance of reducing emissions. [[France 24]] reported that several crew would fly to New York to take the yacht back to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.france24.com/en/20190826-greta-thunberg-s-yacht-due-in-new-york-on-tuesday|title=Greta Thunberg's yacht due in New York on Tuesday|date=26 August 2019|website=France 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The voyage lasted 15 days, from 14 to 28 August 2019. While in the Americas, Thunberg attended the [[UN Climate Action Summit (2019)|UN Climate Action Summit]] in New York City, and will attend the [[COP 25]] [[2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Climate Change Conference]] in Santiago, Chile, in December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Watts |first1=Jonathan |title=Greta Thunberg sets sail for New York on zero-carbon yacht |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/14/greta-thunberg-sets-sail-plymouth-climate-us-trump |website=The Guardian |accessdate=1 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190901010705/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/14/greta-thunberg-sets-sail-plymouth-climate-us-trump |archive-date=1 September 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NEWS-CNN(2019-08-28)"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/28/us/greta-thunberg-new-york-landfall-scli-intl/index.html |title=Greta Thunberg reaches New York after 15-day yacht journey |last=Picheta |first=Rob |access-date=28 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190828101932/https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/28/us/greta-thunberg-new-york-landfall-scli-intl/index.html |archive-date=28 August 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thunberg filed of a lawsuit against France, Germany and other countries for not being on track to meet the emission reduction targets they committed to in their Paris Agreement pledges.

===Support===
In February 2019, 224 academics signed an open letter of support stating they were inspired by the actions of Thunberg and the striking school children in making their voices heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=School climate strike children's brave stand has our support |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/13/school-climate-strike-childrens-brave-stand-has-our-support |newspaper=The Guardian |date=13 February 2019 |accessdate=22 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190825072245/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/13/school-climate-strike-childrens-brave-stand-has-our-support |archive-date=25 August 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] [[António Guterres]] also endorsed the school strikes initiated by Thunberg, admitting that "My generation has failed to respond properly to the dramatic challenge of climate change. This is deeply felt by young people. No wonder they are angry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/15/climate-strikers-urgency-un-summit-world-leaders |title=The climate strikers should inspire us all to act at the next UN summit |date=15 March 2019 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=18 March 2019 |author-link=António Guterres |first=António |last=Guterres |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190318075042/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/15/climate-strikers-urgency-un-summit-world-leaders |archive-date=18 March 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking at an event in New Zealand in May 2019, Guterres said his generation was "not winning the battle against climate change" and that it's up to youth to "rescue the planet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&amp;objectid=12230530 |title=UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says his generation should have done more on climate change |last=Walls |first=Jason |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=13 May 2019 |accessdate=22 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190516124801/https://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&amp;objectid=12230530 |archive-date=16 May 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2019, Thunberg spoke by video link with [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]] who had submitted the [[Green New Deal]] to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in February 2019, which calls for the United States to achieve "net-zero" [[greenhouse gas]]es within a decade.

=== "The Greta effect" ===
Thunberg has inspired a number of her school-aged peers in what has been described as the "The Greta effect".&lt;ref name="NEWS-BBC(2019-05-03)"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-48114220 |title=The Greta effect?

Britain's secretary for the environment, [[Michael Gove]], said: "When I listened to you, I felt great admiration, but also responsibility and guilt. I am of your parents' generation, and I recognise that we haven't done nearly enough to address climate change and the broader environmental crisis that we helped to create." Labour politician [[Ed Miliband]], who was responsible for introducing the [[Climate Change Act 2008]], said: "You have woken us up. We thank you. All the young people who have gone on strike have held up a mirror to our society … you have taught us all a really important lesson. You have stood out from the crowd."&lt;ref name="NEWS-Guardian(2019-04-23)"/&gt; In June 2019, a [[YouGov]] poll in Britain found that public concern about the environment had soared to record levels in the UK since Thunberg and [[Extinction Rebellion]] had "pierced the bubble of denial".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/10/extinction-rebellion-bubble-denial-climate-crisis |title=Extinction Rebellion's tactics are working.

In August 2019, a doubling in the number of children's books being published which address the climate crisis was reported, with a similar increase in the sales of such books—all aimed at empowering young people to save the planet. Publishers attribute this to the "Greta effect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ferguson|first=Donna|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/11/greta-thunberg-leads-to-boom-in-books-aimed-at-empowering-children-to-save-planet|title='Greta effect' leads to boom in children's environmental books|work=The Guardian|date=11 August 2019|accessdate=21 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190820213506/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/11/greta-thunberg-leads-to-boom-in-books-aimed-at-empowering-children-to-save-planet|archive-date=20 August 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2019, Thunberg shared a stage with the then [[President of the European Commission]], [[Jean-Claude Juncker]], where he outlined "In the next financial period from 2021 to 2027, every fourth euro spent within the EU budget will go towards action to mitigate climate change".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-teen-activist-idUSKCN1QA1RF |title=Swedish student leader wins EU pledge to spend billions on climate |last=Roth |first=Clare |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=21 February 2019 |accessdate=22 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190625222613/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-teen-activist-idUSKCN1QA1RF |archive-date=25 June 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate issues also played a significant role in [[2019 European Parliament election|European Parliament election]] in May 2019&lt;ref name="Huggler"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/05/19/europes-greens-sense-moment-climate-takes-centre-stage-elections/ |title=The Greta effect?

In June 2019, [[SJ AB|Swedish Railways]] (SJ) reported that the number of Swedes taking the train for domestic journeys had risen by 8% from the previous year, reflecting growing public concern about the impact of flying on {{CO2}} emissions that is highlighted by Thunberg's refusal to fly to international conferences. Being embarrassed or ashamed to take a plane because of its environmental impact has been described on social media as ''[[flygskam]]'' or 'shame of flying', along with the hashtag #jagstannarpåmarken, which translates as #istayontheground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/04/stayontheground-swedes-turn-to-trains-amid-climate-flight-shame|title=#stayontheground: Swedes turn to trains amid climate 'flight shame'|newspaper=The Guardian|last=Henley|first=Jon|date=4 June 2019|accessdate=22 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721052837/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/04/stayontheground-swedes-turn-to-trains-amid-climate-flight-shame|archive-date=21 July 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/26/greta-thunberg-train-journey-through-europe-flygskam-no-fly|title=Greta Thunberg's train journey through Europe highlights no-fly movement|work=The Guardian|last=Orange|first=Richard|date=26 April 2019|accessdate=4 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704101248/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/26/greta-thunberg-train-journey-through-europe-flygskam-no-fly|archive-date=4 July 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism and response ===
==== Criticism of Thunberg and her campaign====
Thunberg and her campaign has had negative reactions from some politicians - notably the President of Russia [[Vladimir Putin]], U.S. President [[Donald Trump]], and French president [[Emmanuel Macron]] - [[OPEC]], and some media commentators. The criticism ranges from claiming she oversimplifies the complex issues involved to [[climate change denial]].

In October 2019, Vladimir Putin described Thunberg as "kind girl and very sincere", while suggesting she was being manipulated to serve others' interests. Putin criticized her as "poorly informed": "No one has explained to Greta that the modern world is complex and different and people in Africa or in many Asian countries want to live at the same wealth level as in Sweden." Similar to her reaction to Trump, Thunberg updated her Twitter bio to reflect Putin's description of her.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources:

Following Thunberg's filing of a lawsuit against France, Germany and other countries for not being on track to meet the emission reduction targets they committed to in their Paris Agreement pledges, Emmanuel Macron criticised her, saying that "such radical positions (as held by Thunberg) antagonise our societies". He added that "she should focus on those that are blocking, those that are the furthest", and that "he doesn't feel like either the French or the German governments are trying to block". French secretary of state for the Ecological and Inclusive Transition [[Brune Poirson]] also criticised her, saying that "she doesn't know what solutions she is putting forward", adding that "you can't mobilise with despair, even hate".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/emmanuel-macron-reproche-a-greta-thunberg-d-antagoniser-nos-societes-20190924|title=Climat: Emmanuel Macron reproche à Greta Thunberg d'"antagoniser nos sociétés"|last=Feertchak|first=Alexis|date=24 September 2019|website=Le Figaro|language=fr-FR|access-date=24 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2019, Donald Trump shared a video of Thunberg angrily addressing world leaders, along with a quote of hers that "people are dying, entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction". Trump mocked Thunberg, writing: "She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!" Thunberg reacted by changing her Twitter bio to match his description, and stating she could not "understand why grown-ups would choose to mock children and teenagers for just communicating and acting on the science when they could do something good instead."&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources:

In one recent speech, at the [[2019 UN Climate Action Summit]] on September 23, 2019, Thunberg said to world leaders
&lt;blockquote&gt;"This is all wrong. I shouldn’t be standing here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to me for hope? ''How dare you!'' You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. And yet I’m one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction. And all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/23/world-leaders-generation-climate-breakdown-greta-thunberg|title=If world leaders choose to fail us, my generation will never forgive them {{!}} Greta Thunberg|last=Thunberg|first=Greta|date=23 September 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=23 September 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190923160144/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/23/world-leaders-generation-climate-breakdown-greta-thunberg|archive-date=23 September 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, about three months into her [[school climate strike]], Thunberg was nominated for the ''Children's Climate Prize'', which is awarded by the Swedish electricity company Telge Energi.

On 13 March 2019, two deputies of the [[Riksdag|Swedish parliament]] and three deputies of the [[Storting|Norwegian parliament]] nominated Thunberg as a candidate for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].
