Klein wrote the book ''[[No Logo]]'' ([[2000]]), which became a [[manifesto]] of the [[anti-globalization movement]].  She has also written ''Fences and Windows'' ([[2002]]) and contributes to ''[[The Nation]]'', ''[[In These Times]]'', [[Canada]]'s ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', and ''[[The Guardian]]'' in [[Britain]].

''No Logo'' was one of the first publications to receive feedback from [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], a company she often criticises throughout the book.

Klein is married to Canadian television journalist [[Avi Lewis]], who is the son of [[United Nations]] Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa [[Stephen Lewis]] and of Canadian journalist [[Michele Landsberg]].
