'''Greta Ernman Thunberg''' ({{IPA-sv|²ɡreːta ²tʉːnbærj}}; born 3 January 2003) is a [[Swedes|Swedish]] political [[activism|activist]] seeking to stop [[global warming|global warming]] and climate change. In August 2018, she became a prominent figure for starting the first [[school strike for climate]], outside the [[Riksdag|Swedish parliament building]].&lt;ref name="Guardian1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/sep/01/swedish-15-year-old-cutting-class-to-fight-the-climate-crisis |title=The Swedish 15-year-old who's cutting class to fight the climate crisis |date=1 September 2018 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2018, she spoke at [[TED (conference)#TEDx|TEDxStockholm]], in December she addressed the [[2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference]] and in January 2019 she was invited to talk to the [[World Economic Forum]] at [[Davos]].

In December 2018, Thunberg described herself as having been "''diagnosed with [[Asperger syndrome]], [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD), and [[selective mutism]]''".&lt;ref name="Thunberg_20181212"&gt;{{cite AV media |author-first=Greta |author-last=Thunberg &lt;!-- or |date=24 November 2018 --&gt;|date=12 December 2018 |title=School strike for climate – save the world by changing the rules |work=TEDxStockholm |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAmmUIEsN9A |access-date=29 January 2019 |time=1:46 |location=Stockholm |publisher=TED |quote=I was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrom, OCD, and selective mutism.

On 20 August 2018, Thunberg, who back then had just started ninth grade, decided to not attend school until the [[Swedish general election, 2018|2018 Sweden general election]] on 9 September after [[2018 European heat wave|heat waves]] and [[2018 Sweden wildfires|wildfires]] in Sweden.&lt;ref name=Guardian1/&gt;  Her demands were that the Swedish government reduce carbon emissions in accordance with the [[Paris Agreement]], and she protested by sitting outside the [[Riksdag]] every day during school hours with the sign ''Skolstrejk för klimatet'' (school strike for the climate).&lt;ref name=Newyorker1&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-fifteen-year-old-climate-activist-who-is-demanding-a-new-kind-of-politics |title=The Fifteen-Year-Old Climate Activist Who Is Demanding a New Kind of Politics |date=2 October 2018 |website=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the general elections, she continued to strike only on Fridays, gaining worldwide attention. She inspired school students across the globe to take part in student strikes.&lt;ref name=Guardian2/&gt; As of December 2018, more than 20,000 students had held strikes in at least 270 cities.&lt;ref name=Guardian2/&gt;  Thunberg credits the teen activists at [[Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School|Parkland school]] in Florida, who organized the [[March For Our Lives]], as the inspiration to begin her school climate strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Teen activist on climate change: If we don't do anything right now, we're screwed |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGmBkIUwYkA |accessdate=10 February 2019 |agency=CNN |date=23 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Guardian view on teenage activists: protesters not puppets – Editorial |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/07/the-guardian-view-on-teenage-activists-look-whos-pulling-the-strings |accessdate=11 February 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=7 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other activism ==
Greta Thunberg participated in the Rise for Climate demonstration outside the [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]]. In October 2018, Thunberg and her family drove in an [[electric car]] to [[London]], where she addressed the 'Declaration of Rebellion' organized by [[Extinction Rebellion]] opposite the [[Houses of Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/10/31/our-darkest-hour-declaration-rebellion-new-group-vows-mass-civil-disobedience-save |title=This Is Our Darkest Hour: With Declaration of Rebellion, New Group Vows Mass Civil Disobedience to Save Planet |date=31 October 2018 |work=Common Dreams}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rizvi |first1=Husna |title=For climate action, ‘mass civil disobedience’ is the only way |url=https://newint.org/features/2018/11/01/climate-breakdown |accessdate=15 February 2019 |work=New Internationalist |date=1 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 November 2018, she spoke at [[TED (conference)#TEDx|TEDxStockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TEDxStockholm Theme: Wonderland |url=https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/31825 |publisher=TED |accessdate=20 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jon |last=Queally |title=Depressed and Then Diagnosed With Autism, Greta Thunberg Explains Why Hope Cannot Save Planet But Bold Climate Action Still Can |url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/12/19/depressed-and-then-diagnosed-autism-greta-thunberg-explains-why-hope-cannot-save |publisher=Common Dreams |accessdate=20 December 2018 |date=19 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thunberg_20181212"/&gt; She spoke about realising, when she was eight years old, that [[global warming|climate change]] existed and wondering why it was not headline news on every channel, as if there was a world war going on. She said she did not go to school to become a climate scientist, as some suggested, because the science was done and only denial, ignorance and inaction was remaining. Speculating that her children and grandchildren would ask her why they had not taken action in 2018 when there was still time, she concluded with "''we can’t change the world by playing by the rules, because the rules have to be changed.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=Nigel |title=Why we all need to be more like Greta |url=https://medium.com/nine-by-five-media/why-we-all-need-to-be-more-like-greta-ba36abec961 |accessdate=15 February 2019 |work=Nine by Five Media |publisher=Medium |date=30 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

You only talk about moving forward with the same bad ideas that got us into this mess, even when the only sensible thing to do is pull the emergency brake. You are not mature enough to tell it like it is. Even that burden you leave to us children.

On 21 February 2019, she spoke at a conference of the [[European Economic and Social Committee]] and to [[European Commission]] chief [[Jean-Claude Juncker]], where she demanded that to still meet the climate goals the [[EU]] must reduce their [[carbon dioxide|{{CO2}}]] emissions by at least 80% until 2030.

== Prizes and awards ==
Greta Thunberg was one of the winners of [[Svenska Dagbladet]]'s debate article writing competition on the climate for young people in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.svd.se/vi-vet--och-vi-kan-gora-nagot-nu|title="Vi vet – och vi kan göra något nu" {{!}} SvD|website=SvD.se|language=sv|access-date=22 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunberg was nominated for the electricity company Telge Energi's prize for children and young people who promote sustainable development, ''Children's Climate Prize,'' but declined because the finalists would have to fly to Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etc.se/klimat/darfor-nobbar-greta-thunberg-klimatpriset|title=Därför nobbar Greta Thunberg klimatpriset|last=Gelin|first=Gustav|date=1 November 2018|website=ETC|language=sv|access-date=22 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2018, she was awarded the Fryshuset scholarship of the Young Role Model of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aktuellhallbarhet.se/greta-thunberg-blir-arets-unga-forebild/|title=Greta Thunberg blir Årets unga förebild|date=22 November 2018|website=Aktuell Hållbarhet|language=sv-SE|access-date=22 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2018, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named Thunberg one of the world's 25 most influential teenagers of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/5463721/most-influential-teens-2018/|title=TIME's 25 Most Influential Teens of 2018|website=Time|language=en|access-date=22 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the occasion of the [[International Women's Day]] Thunberg was proclaimed the most important woman of the year in Sweden in 2019. The award was based on a survey by the institute ''Inizio'' on behalf of the newspaper [[Aftonbladet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Schulstreik fürs Klima – Klimaaktivistin Greta Thunberg in Schweden "Frau des Jahres"'' |language=de |author=dpa |journal=[[Zeit Online]] |date=8 March 2019 |url=https://www.zeit.de/news/2019-03/08/klimaaktivistin-greta-thunberg-in-schweden-frau-des-jahres-190308-99-297313 |access-date=8 March 2019 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190309164608/https://www.zeit.de/news/2019-03/08/klimaaktivistin-greta-thunberg-in-schweden-frau-des-jahres-190308-99-297313 |archive-date=8 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three Norwegian lawmakers nominated Thunberg for the 2019 [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/teen-climate-activist-in-nobel-peace-prize-race/article26526361.ece|title=Teen climate activist in Nobel Peace Prize race|agency=Associated Press|date=14 March 2019|work=The Hindu|access-date=14 March 2019|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47568227 |title=Greta Thunberg nominated for Nobel Peace Prize for climate activism |publisher=BBC News |date=14 March 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy over affiliations ==
After her student climate strikes gained momentum, attempts were made to discredit her, &lt;ref name="Vice-GWPF"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sandler Clarke |first1=Joe |title=The Climate Change Deniers Trying to Discredit Greta Thunberg |url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/mbzg8q/the-climate-change-deniers-trying-to-discredit-greta-thunberg |work=Vice |date=7 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others tried to benefit from her high profile. &lt;ref name="Politico-Feb12"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Oroschakoff |first1=Kalina |title=Teen climate icon used for fundraising without her knowledge |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/greta-thunberg-teen-climate-icon-used-for-fundraising-without-her-knowledge/ |work=Politico-EU |date=February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2018, Ingmar Rentzhog, founder of the non-profit We Don't Have Time Foundation (WDHT), recruited Thunberg to become an unpaid youth advisor and used Thunberg's name and image without her knowledge or permission to raise millions for WDHT's for-profit subsidiary We Don't Have Time AB, of which Rentzhog is CEO.
