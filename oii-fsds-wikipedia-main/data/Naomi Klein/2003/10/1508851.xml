<text bytes="888" sha1="m832os7nkra7styfyjl2xpcxruhmo0b" xml:space="preserve">'''Naomi Klein''', Canadian journalist, author and activist, was born in [[Montreal]], [[Canada]] in [[1970]]. 

She is the author of ''[[No Logo]]'' ([[2000]]), which became a [[manifesto]] of the [[anti-globalization movement]].  She is also the author of ''Fences and Windows'' ([[2002]]). She also writes for ''[[The Nation]]'', ''[[In These Times]]'', [[Canada]]'s ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', and ''[[The Guardian]]'' in Britain.

Her book ''[[No Logo]]'' was one of the first publications to receive feedback from [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], a company she oft-criticises throughout the book. After writing the book, she was fired from her job at the ''[[Toronto Star]]''.
