Thunberg's activism began by persuading her parents to adopt [[Individual action on climate change|lifestyle choices]] that reduced their own [[carbon footprint]]. In August 2018, at age 15, she started spending her school days outside the [[Swedish Parliament]] to call for stronger [[Climate change mitigation|action on climate change]] by holding up a sign reading ''{{lang|se|Skolstrejk för klimatet}}'' ([[School strike for climate]]). Soon other students engaged in similar protests in their own communities. Together they organised a [[school climate strike]] movement under the name ''[[Fridays for Future]]''. After Thunberg addressed the [[2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference]], student strikes took place every week somewhere in the world. In 2019, there were multiple coordinated multi-city protests involving over a million students each.&lt;ref name="NEWS-Time(2019-05-24)"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://time.com/5595365/global-climate-strikes-greta-thunberg/ |title=Students From 1,600 Cities Just Walked Out of School to Protest Climate Change.

In August 2018, Thunberg began the school climate strikes and public speeches for which she has become an internationally recognized [[climate activist]]. In an interview with [[Amy Goodman]] from ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', she said she first got the idea of a climate strike after [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting|school shootings in the United States in February 2018]] led to several youths refusing to go back to school.&lt;ref name="Democracy Now"&gt;{{cite interview |url=https://www.democracynow.org/2018/12/11/meet_the_15_year_old_swedish |title=School Strike for Climate: Meet 15-Year-Old Activist Greta Thunberg, Who Inspired a Global Movement |last=Thunberg |first=Greta |interviewer=[[Amy Goodman]] |website=[[Democracy Now!]] |date=11 December 2018 |access-date=22 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190717102212/https://www.democracynow.org/2018/12/11/meet_the_15_year_old_swedish |archive-date=17 July 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; These teen activists at [[Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School]] in [[Parkland, Florida]], went on to organize the [[March for Our Lives]] in support of greater [[gun control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |title=Teen activist on climate change: If we don't do anything right now, we're screwed |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGmBkIUwYkA |last=Thunberg |first=Greta |interviewer=[[Fareed Zakaria]] |agency=[[CNN]] |via=YouTube |date=23 December 2018|access-date=10 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190315172703/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGmBkIUwYkA|archive-date=15 March 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Guardian view on teenage activists: protesters not puppets |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/07/the-guardian-view-on-teenage-activists-look-whos-pulling-the-strings |access-date=11 February 2019 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=7 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190211043029/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/07/the-guardian-view-on-teenage-activists-look-whos-pulling-the-strings |archive-date=11 February 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2018, Thunberg won a climate change essay competition held by Swedish newspaper ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]''. In part, she wrote "I want to feel safe. How can I feel safe when I know we are in the greatest crisis in human history?"&lt;ref name="NEWS-Wired(6-6-2019)" /&gt;

After the paper published her article, she was contacted by Bo Thorén from Fossil Free Dalsland, a group interested in doing something about climate change. Thunberg attended a few of their meetings. At one of them, Thorén suggested that school children could strike for climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.goodthingsguy.com/opinion/greta-thunberg/ |title=Greta Thunberg: School strike for climate and to save the world! |date=5 May 2019 |website=Good Things Guy |access-date=12 May 2019 |last=Lindeque |first=Brent |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200611001013/https://www.goodthingsguy.com/opinion/greta-thunberg/ |archive-date=11 June 2020 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunberg tried to persuade other young people to get involved but "no one was really interested", so eventually she decided to go ahead with the strike by herself.&lt;ref name="Democracy Now" /&gt;

On 20 August 2018, Thunberg, who had just started ninth grade, decided not to attend school until the [[2018 Swedish general election]] on 9 September; her protest began after the [[2018 European heat wave|heat waves]] and [[2018 Sweden wildfires|wildfires]] during Sweden's hottest summer in at least 262 years.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Her demands were that the Swedish government reduce [[carbon emissions]] in accordance with the [[Paris Agreement]], and she protested by sitting outside the [[Riksdag]] every day for three weeks during school hours with the sign ''Skolstrejk för klimatet'' (School strike for climate).&lt;ref name="Newyorker1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-fifteen-year-old-climate-activist-who-is-demanding-a-new-kind-of-politics |title=The Fifteen-Year-Old Climate Activist Who Is Demanding a New Kind of Politics |date=2 October 2018 |newspaper=[[The New Yorker]] |last=Gessen |first=Masha |author-link=Masha Gessen |access-date=22 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190105223945/https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-fifteen-year-old-climate-activist-who-is-demanding-a-new-kind-of-politics |archive-date=5 January 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.techwarrant.com/time-person-of-the-year-is-greta-thunberg/ |title=Time Person Of The Year Is Greta Thunberg |date=12 December 2019 |newspaper=Tech Warrant |access-date=15 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191215212835/https://www.techwarrant.com/time-person-of-the-year-is-greta-thunberg/ |archive-date=15 December 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thunberg said her teachers were divided in their views about her missing class to make her point. She says: "As people, they think what I am doing is good, but as teachers, they say I should stop."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

=== Social media activism ===
Thunberg posted a photo of her first strike day on [[Instagram]] and [[Twitter]], with other [[social media]] accounts quickly taking up her cause. High-profile [[Youth activism|youth activists]] amplified her [[Instagram]] post, and on the second day she was joined by other activists. A representative of the Finnish bank [[Nordea]] quoted one of Thunberg's tweets to more than 200,000 followers. Thunberg's social media profile attracted local reporters whose stories earned international coverage in little more than a week.&lt;ref name="wired.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/greta-thunberg-climate-crisis |first=Amelia |last=Tait |title=Greta Thunberg: How one teenager became the voice of the planet |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190823154313/https://www.wired.co.uk/article/greta-thunberg-climate-crisis |archive-date=23 August 2019 |work=Wired|date=6 June 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One Swedish climate-focused social media company was ''We Don't Have Time'' (WDHT), founded by Ingmar Rentzhog. He said her strike only began attracting public attention after he turned up with a freelance photographer and posted Thunberg's photograph on his [[Facebook]] page and Instagram account, and a video in English that he posted on the company's [[YouTube]] channel.&lt;ref name="TheLocal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thelocal.se/20190209/start-up-used-child-climate-activist-to-raise-millions |title=Start-up used teen climate activist to raise millions: Swedish paper |newspaper=[[The Local]] |date=9 February 2019 |access-date=22 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727001257/https://www.thelocal.se/20190209/start-up-used-child-climate-activist-to-raise-millions |archive-date=27 July 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rentzhog subsequently asked Thunberg to become an unpaid youth advisor to WDHT.

After October 2018, Thunberg's activism evolved from solitary protesting to taking part in demonstrations throughout Europe; making several high-profile public speeches, and mobilizing her growing number of followers on [[social media]] platforms. After the December 2018 general elections, Thunberg continued to strike only on Fridays. She inspired school students across the globe to take part in student strikes. That month, more than 20,000 students had held strikes in at least 270 cities.&lt;ref name="Guardian2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/04/leaders-like-children-school-strike-founder-greta-thunberg-tells-un-climate-summit|title='Our leaders are like children', school strike founder tells climate summit|last=Carrington|first=Damian|date=4 December 2018|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=22 July 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190102050002/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/04/leaders-like-children-school-strike-founder-greta-thunberg-tells-un-climate-summit|archive-date=2 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thunberg spoke out against the [[National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (Undergraduate)]] 2020 and [[Joint Entrance Examination]] 2020 entrance exams, which are being conducted in India in September. She said that it is unfair for students to appear for exams in the middle of a global pandemic. She also said that the students of India have been deeply impacted by the floods that hit states such as [[Bihar]] and [[Assam]], which cause mass destruction for the citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/news/story/conduction-of-national-exams-unfair-for-students-greta-thunberg-on-neet-jee-exams-2020-1714841-2020-08-25 |title=Deeply unfair to students: Now activist Greta Thunberg seeks postponement of JEE, NEET exams |access-date=25 August 2020 |archive-date=25 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200825113438/https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/news/story/conduction-of-national-exams-unfair-for-students-greta-thunberg-on-neet-jee-exams-2020-1714841-2020-08-25 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, Thunberg has argued that commitments made at the Paris Agreement are insufficient to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, and that the greenhouse gas emissions curve needs to start declining steeply no later than 2020—as detailed in the IPCC's [[Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C|2018 Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5° C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/07/29/deliver-fundamental-message-survival-future-generations-greta-thunberg-sail-atlantic|title=To Deliver 'Fundamental Message' for 'Survival of Future Generations,' Greta Thunberg to Sail Atlantic for Americas|last=Germanos|first=Andrea|date=29 July 2019|website=Common Dreams|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190831085522/https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/07/29/deliver-fundamental-message-survival-future-generations-greta-thunberg-sail-atlantic|archive-date=31 August 2019|access-date=31 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian MPS Speech" /&gt; In February 2019, at a conference of the [[European Economic and Social Committee]], she said that the EU's current intention to cut emissions by 40% by 2030 is "not sufficient to protect the future for children growing up today" and that the [[European Union|EU]] must reduce their {{CO2}} emissions by 80%, double the 40% goal.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/climate-activist-thunberg-urges-eu-double-carbon-reduction-111042030.html|title=Climate activist Thunberg urges EU to double carbon reduction targets|last=Carmichael|first=Lachlan|date=22 February 2019|access-date=22 February 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190221172831/https://news.yahoo.com/climate-activist-thunberg-urges-eu-double-carbon-reduction-111042030.html|archive-date=21 February 2019|agency=Agence France-Presse|via=Yahoo!

Asked about widely respected New Zealand prime minister [[Jacinda Ardern]], who described the climate crisis as a matter of life or death, Thunberg commented "It's funny that people believe Jacinda Ardern and people like that are climate leaders. That just tells you how little people know about the climate crisis." Thunberg ignores words and sentiments: "Obviously the emissions haven't fallen. It goes without saying that these people are not doing anything" (in fact New Zealand's greenhouse-gas emissions had increased by 2% in 2019).&lt;ref name=hattenstone/&gt;

In September 2019, Trump shared a video of Thunberg angrily addressing world leaders, along with her quote that "people are dying, entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a [[Holocene extinction|mass extinction]]." Trump wrote about Thunberg, tweeting: "She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!" Thunberg reacted by changing her Twitter bio to match his description, and stating that she could not "understand why grown-ups would choose to mock children and teenagers for just communicating and acting on the science when they could do something good instead."&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources:

In October 2019, Putin described Thunberg as a "kind girl and very sincere", while suggesting she was being manipulated to serve others' interests. Putin criticized her as "poorly informed", adding: "No one has explained to Greta that the modern world is complex and different and people in Africa or in many Asian countries want to live at the same wealth level as in Sweden." Similar to her reaction to Trump, Thunberg updated her Twitter bio to reflect Putin's description of her.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources:

=== "The Greta effect" ===
[[File:GrèveClimatGenève-27sept2019-041-RuesBasses.jpg|thumb|[[September 2019 climate strike]] in Geneva]]
Thunberg has inspired a number of her school-aged peers in what has been described as "the Greta effect".&lt;ref name="NEWS-BBC(2019-05-03)"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-48114220 |title=The Greta effect?

Britain's secretary for the environment, [[Michael Gove]], said: "When I listened to you, I felt great admiration, but also responsibility and guilt. I am of your parents' generation, and I recognize that we haven't done nearly enough to address climate change and the broader environmental crisis that we helped to create." Labour politician [[Ed Miliband]], who was responsible for introducing the [[Climate Change Act 2008]], said: "You have woken us up. [T]hank you. All the young people who have gone on strike have held up a mirror to our society … you have taught us all a really important lesson. You have stood out from the crowd."&lt;ref name="NEWS-Guardian(2019-04-23)"/&gt;

In February 2019, Thunberg shared a stage with the then [[President of the European Commission]], [[Jean-Claude Juncker]], where he outlined: "In the next financial period from 2021 to 2027, every fourth euro spent within the EU budget will go towards action to mitigate climate change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-teen-activist-idUSKCN1QA1RF|title=Swedish student leader wins EU pledge to spend billions on climate|last=Roth|first=Clare|date=21 February 2019|access-date=22 July 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190625222613/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-teen-activist-idUSKCN1QA1RF|archive-date=25 June 2019|work=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate issues also played a significant role in [[2019 European Parliament election|European Parliament election]] in May 2019&lt;ref name="Huggler"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/05/19/europes-greens-sense-moment-climate-takes-centre-stage-elections/|title=The Greta effect?

According to a 2021 study, "those who are more familiar with Greta Thunberg have higher intentions of taking collective actions to reduce global warming and that stronger collective efficacy beliefs mediate this relationship. This association between familiarity with Greta Thunberg, collective efficacy beliefs, and collective action intentions is present even after accounting for respondents' overall support for climate activism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Sabherwal|first1=Anandita|last2=Ballew|first2=Matthew T.|last3=Linden|first3=Sander van der|last4=Gustafson|first4=Abel|last5=Goldberg|first5=Matthew H.|last6=Maibach|first6=Edward W.|last7=Kotcher|first7=John E.|last8=Swim|first8=Janet K.|last9=Rosenthal|first9=Seth A.|last10=Leiserowitz|first10=Anthony|title=The Greta Thunberg Effect: Familiarity with Greta Thunberg predicts intentions to engage in climate activism in the United States|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|year=2021|volume=51|issue=4|pages=321–333|language=en|doi=10.1111/jasp.12737|issn=1559-1816|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facebook page management===
In mid-January&lt;!--Jan 9 to 10--&gt; 2020, a several hours long Facebook glitch enabled users to see which admins were responsible for editing posts on Facebook pages. It was found that some of the posts on Greta Thunberg's page had actually been made from the accounts of Svante Thunberg, her father, and Adarsh Prathap, an Indian climate change activist. It suggested that Greta Thunberg might not have posted herself.&lt;ref name=express20200113&gt;{{cite web|title=Greta Thunberg forced to explain her Facebook posts after her DAD appears to control page|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1227896/greta-thunberg-climate-change-activist-Facebook-page-social-media-posts-edited|author=Laura O'Callaghan|publisher=Daily Express|date=2020-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Thunberg said that she had written all the posts herself, and explained on her personal Facebook that she used her father's account to repost her content from Twitter and Instagram since she had "chosen not to be on Facebook personally"; while Prathap had founded and co-managed the Greta Thunberg Facebook page, also reposting Thunberg's own content. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/732846497083173/posts/1031956330505520|title=Some people have been asking who manages this page.|author=Greta Thunberg|date=2020-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=express20200113/&gt; Later in some media coverage, Adarsh Prathap is referred to as Greta Thunberg's "social media manager".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greta Thunberg's Indian Social Media Manager Receives Cyber Backlash After Her Tweet On Farmers' Protest|url=https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/current-affairs-trends/greta-thunbergs-indian-social-media-manager-receives-cyber-backlash-after-her-tweet-on-farmers-protest-6457771.html|author=Rajesh V|author2=Meera Manu|publisher=Moneycontroldate=2021-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 April 2021, Facebook user "James Hsieh" posted two photos with the phrase "How dare you?" featuring what appeared to be Thunberg, prompting commenters to observe that the subject in the photos was more overweight than she had been in the past. The [[Factcheck Lab]] in [[Hong Kong]] [[Fact-checking|factchecked]] the two images and concluded that they were photoshopped. The Factcheck Lab also determined that many widespread images [[fat-shaming]] Thunberg were either photoshopped images or old images taken before Thunberg become famous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=網傳「環保少女」通貝利「長胖」的照片，實為改圖或舊照 |url=https://beta.thestandnews.com/society/%E7%B6%B2%E5%82%B3-%E7%92%B0%E4%BF%9D%E5%B0%91%E5%A5%B3-%E9%80%9A%E8%B2%9D%E5%88%A9-%E9%95%B7%E8%83%96-%E7%9A%84%E7%85%A7%E7%89%87-%E5%AF%A6%E7%82%BA%E6%94%B9%E5%9C%96%E6%88%96%E8%88%8A%E7%85%A7 |publisher=立場新聞 |date=22 April 2021|archivedate=26 May 2021|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20210526185301/https://beta.thestandnews.com/society/%E7%B6%B2%E5%82%B3-%E7%92%B0%E4%BF%9D%E5%B0%91%E5%A5%B3-%E9%80%9A%E8%B2%9D%E5%88%A9-%E9%95%B7%E8%83%96-%E7%9A%84%E7%85%A7%E7%89%87-%E5%AF%A6%E7%82%BA%E6%94%B9%E5%9C%96%E6%88%96%E8%88%8A%E7%85%A7}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 May 2021, after Thunberg said that China's carbon emissions exceeded those of all developed countries combined, the official website of ''[[China Daily]]'' retaliated by fat-shaming Thunberg, and questioning her vegetarianism. Thunberg reacted to this by tweeting, "Being fat-shamed by Chinese state owned media is a pretty weird experience even by my standards.

A sticker was handed out by X-Site Energy Services of Alberta, Canada, with the company's name on it with an image of a man grabbing the braids of a girl while raping her from behind, and the word "Greta" on the image.  Then 17 year old Greta Thunberg posted about it on Twitter  "They are starting to get more and more desperate. This shows that we're winning."
