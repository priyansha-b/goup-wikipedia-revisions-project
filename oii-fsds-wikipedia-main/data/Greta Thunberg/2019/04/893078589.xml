'''Greta Ernman Thunberg''' ({{IPA-sv|²ɡreːta ²tʉːnbærj}}; born 3 January 2003) is a Swedish schoolgirl [[Individual and political action on climate change|climate activist]] who has been described as a role model for worldwide student activism.&lt;!-- original text was "is an iconic role model for worldwide student activism", is this appropriate for the lead? The old phrasing has neutrality concerns, and seem like an opinion. The sources obviously present her with a positive POV. Should this phrase be removed from the lead altogether or possibly include later in the article saying that some notable people (would need to find examples) have stated that she is a role model? --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acrimonia.it/en/2019/03/wmn-role-models-greta-thunberg/ |title=WMN role models: Greta Thunberg |author-last=Nava |author-first=Alessandra |date=18 March 2019 |website=Acrimònia |access-date=9 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.insidescandinavianbusiness.com/article.php?id=371 |title=Greta Thunberg Wins German Award |author-last=Lindgren |author-first=Emma |date=2 April 2019 |website=Inside Scandinavian Business |access-date=9 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is famous for having initiated the [[school strike for climate]] movement that formed in November 2018 and surged globally after the [[2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP24 conference]] in December the same year. Her personal activism began in August 2018, when her recurring and solitary ''Skolstrejk för klimatet'' ('School strike for the climate') protesting outside the [[Riksdag|Swedish parliament]] in Stockholm soon attracted media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/wedonthavetime/this-15-year-old-girl-breaks-swedish-law-for-the-climate-d1a48ab97e3a |title=This 15-year-old Girl Breaks Swedish Law for the Climate |author-last=Olsson |author-first=David |date=23 August 2018 |website=Medium |access-date=26 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 March 2019, an estimated number of 1.4 million students around the world joined her call in the striking and protesting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://harvardpolitics.com/united-states/youth-demand-climate-action-in-global-school-strike/ |title=Youth Demand Climate Action in Global School Strike |author-last1=Cohen |author-first1=Ilana |author-last2=Heberle |author-first2=Jacob |date=19 March 2019 |website=Harvard Political Review |access-date=22 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next major climate strike to take place globally is scheduled on 24 May 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://peoplesdispatch.org/2019/03/16/over-1-million-students-across-the-world-join-global-climate-strike/ |title=Over 1 million students across the world join Global Climate Strike |author-last=Shabeer |author-first=Muhammed |date=16 March 2019 |newspaper=Peoples Dispatch |access-date=22 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 March 2019, three members of the [[Storting|Norwegian parliament]] nominated Thunberg as a candidate for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] later this year. Thunberg responded that she was 'honoured and very grateful' for the nomination.&lt;ref name="av01"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/climate-activist-greta-thunberg-nobel-peace-prize_n_5c8a4ab8e4b0fbd7662145a4|title=16-Year-Old Climate Activist Greta Thunberg Nominated For Nobel Peace Prize |author-last=Vaglanos |author-first=Alanna |date=14 March 2019 |newspaper=[[Huffington Post]] |access-date=22 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunberg has already received various prizes and awards for her activism.

In November 2018, Thunberg mentioned having been diagnosed with [[Asperger syndrome]], [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD), and [[selective mutism]].&lt;ref name="Thunberg_20181212"&gt;{{cite AV media |author-first=Greta |author-last=Thunberg |author-link=Greta Thunberg &lt;!-- or |date=24 November 2018 --&gt;|date=12 December 2018 |title=School strike for climate – save the world by changing the rules |work=TEDxStockholm |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAmmUIEsN9A |access-date=29 January 2019 |time=1:46 |location=Stockholm |publisher=TED |quote=I was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrom, OCD, and selective mutism.

As a collective [[archetype]], Thunberg has been compared both to French medieval maiden warrior [[Joan of Arc]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/01/02/greta-joan-of-arc-thunberg-shames-leaders-at-cop24/ |title=Greta 'Joan of Arc' Thunberg Shames Leaders at COP24 |author-last=Hunziker |author-first=Robert |date=2 January 2019 |website=CounterPunch |access-date=22 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.noz.de/deutschland-welt/kultur/artikel/1672588/wie-einst-jeanne-d-arc-greta-thunberg-belebt-den-typus-der-jungen-frau-als-lichtgestalt |title=Wie einst Jeanne d'Arc?

This is one of the reasons why Greta Thunberg's commitment has resonated throughout large parts of the world. However, some adults, usually middle-aged people, are questioning her. This is what leads the thoughts to Pippi Longstocking. […] It took some struggling with different publishers before somebody even dared to print [[Astrid Lindgren]]'s book about the rebellious and questioning girl Pippi, as she was a young girl who questioned the habits and mores of adult people. Oh dear, how terrible! When the book about Pippi Longstocking gradually became a world success, parts of it were censored for this very reason. Pippi was too questioning, too rebellious, and did not blindly obey the admonitions from the older generation. […] It is rather obvious that a young person like Greta, still formally a child below 18 of age, should become a symbol of the action against climate destruction throughout the world. Because it is her generation, and their children and grandchildren, who are going to live their lives on this planet.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{undue inline|date=April 2019|reason=Is this paragraph important/encyclopaedic for wikipedia?}}

On 20 August 2018, Thunberg, who back then had just started ninth grade, decided to not attend school until the [[Swedish general election, 2018|2018 Sweden general election]] on 9 September after [[2018 European heat wave|heat waves]] and [[2018 Sweden wildfires|wildfires]] in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/sep/01/swedish-15-year-old-cutting-class-to-fight-the-climate-crisis |title=The Swedish 15-year-old who's cutting class to fight the climate crisis |date=1 September 2018 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her demands were that the Swedish government reduce carbon emissions in accordance with the [[Paris Agreement]], and she protested by sitting outside the [[Riksdag]] every day during school hours with the sign ''Skolstrejk för klimatet'' (school strike for the climate).&lt;ref name="Newyorker1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-fifteen-year-old-climate-activist-who-is-demanding-a-new-kind-of-politics |title=The Fifteen-Year-Old Climate Activist Who Is Demanding a New Kind of Politics |date=2 October 2018 |newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the general elections, she continued to strike only on Fridays, gaining worldwide attention. She inspired school students across the globe to take part in student strikes.&lt;ref name="Guardian2"/&gt; As of December 2018, more than {{val|20000}} students had held strikes in at least 270 cities.&lt;ref name="Guardian2"/&gt; Thunberg credits the teen activists at [[Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School|Parkland school]] in Florida, who organized the [[March For Our Lives]], as the inspiration to begin her school climate strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Teen activist on climate change: If we don't do anything right now, we're screwed |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGmBkIUwYkA |access-date=10 February 2019 |agency=[[CNN]] |date=23 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Guardian view on teenage activists: protesters not puppets – Editorial |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/07/the-guardian-view-on-teenage-activists-look-whos-pulling-the-strings |access-date=11 February 2019 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=7 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From October 2018 onwards, Thunberg's activism evolved from solitary protesting to taking part in demonstrations throughout Europe; making several high profile public speeches; and mobilising her growing number of followers on [[social media]] platforms. However, by March 2019 she still stages her regular protests outside the Swedish parliament every Friday, where other students now occasionally join her. Her activism has not interfered with her schoolwork, but she has had less spare time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/11/greta-thunberg-schoolgirl-climate-change-warrior-some-people-can-let-things-go-i-cant |title=Greta Thunberg, schoolgirl climate change warrior: 'Some people can let things go.

[[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN General Secretary]] [[António Guterres]] has endorsed the school strikes initiated by Thunberg, admitting that "My generation has failed to respond properly to the dramatic challenge of climate change. This is deeply felt by young people. No wonder they are angry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/15/climate-strikers-urgency-un-summit-world-leaders |title=The climate strikers should inspire us all to act at the next UN summit |date=15 March 2019 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=18 March 2019 |author-link=António Guterres |author-first=António |author-last=Guterres}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other activism ==
Greta Thunberg participated in the Rise for Climate demonstration outside the [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]]. In October 2018, Thunberg and her family drove in an [[electric car]] to [[London]], where she addressed the 'Declaration of Rebellion' organized by [[Extinction Rebellion]] opposite the [[Houses of Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/10/31/our-darkest-hour-declaration-rebellion-new-group-vows-mass-civil-disobedience-save |title=This Is Our Darkest Hour: With Declaration of Rebellion, New Group Vows Mass Civil Disobedience to Save Planet |date=31 October 2018 |work=Common Dreams}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author-last=Rizvi |author-first=Husna |title=For climate action, ‘mass civil disobedience’ is the only way |url=https://newint.org/features/2018/11/01/climate-breakdown |access-date=15 February 2019 |work=New Internationalist |date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 November 2018, she spoke at [[TED (conference)#TEDx|TEDxStockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TEDxStockholm Theme: Wonderland |url=https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/31825 |publisher=TED |access-date=20 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author-first=Jon |author-last=Queally |title=Depressed and Then Diagnosed With Autism, Greta Thunberg Explains Why Hope Cannot Save Planet But Bold Climate Action Still Can |url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/12/19/depressed-and-then-diagnosed-autism-greta-thunberg-explains-why-hope-cannot-save |publisher=Common Dreams |access-date=20 December 2018 |date=19 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thunberg_20181212"/&gt; She spoke about realising, when she was eight years old, that [[global warming|climate change]] existed and wondering why it was not headline news on every channel, as if there was a world war going on. She said she did not go to school to become a climate scientist, as some suggested, because the science was done and only denial, ignorance and inaction was remaining. Speculating that her children and grandchildren would ask her why they had not taken action in 2018 when there was still time, she concluded with "we can’t change the world by playing by the rules, because the rules have to be changed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author-last=Jones |author-first=Nigel |title=Why we all need to be more like Greta |url=https://medium.com/nine-by-five-media/why-we-all-need-to-be-more-like-greta-ba36abec961 |access-date=15 February 2019 |work=Nine by Five Media |publisher=Medium |date=30 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 March 2019, three members of the [[Storting|Norwegian parliament]] nominated Thunberg as a candidate for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] later this year. The nominating politicians motivated their decision by arguing that [[global warming]] will be the cause of 'wars, conflict and refugees' if nothing is done to halt it. Thunberg responded that she was 'honoured and very grateful' for the nomination.&lt;ref name="av01"/&gt; If Thunberg receives the Prize later this year, she will become the youngest person ever to receive it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ecowatch.com/greta-thunberg-nobel-peace-prize-2631637803.html?rebelltitem=6#rebelltitem6 |title=Greta Thunberg—Swedish Teen who Inspired School Climate Strikes—Nominated for Nobel Peace Prize |author-last=Rosane |author-first=Olivia |date=14 March 2019 |newspaper=EcoWatch |access-date=22 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
