'''Greta Tintin Eleonora Ernman Thunberg''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈɡrêːta ˈtʉ̂ːnbærj|lang-pron|Sv-Greta Thunberg.ogg}}; born 3 January 2003) is a Swedish [[Environmental movement|environmental activist]] known for challenging world leaders to take immediate action for [[climate change mitigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-48018034/climate-change-activist-greta-thunberg-listen-to-climate-scientists|title=It's an existential crisis.

Thunberg's climate activism began when she persuaded her parents to adopt [[Individual action on climate change|lifestyle choices]] that reduced her family's [[carbon footprint]]. At age 15, Thunberg began skipping school on 20 August 2018, vowing to remain out of school until after the national Swedish election in an attempt to influence the outcome. She protested outside the [[Riksdag|Swedish parliament]] where she called for stronger [[Climate change mitigation|action on climate change]] by holding up a ''{{lang|sv|Skolstrejk för klimatet}}'' ([[School Strike for Climate]]) sign and handing out informational flyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Gibson |first=Caitlin |date=2020-03-16 |title=Before Greta Thunberg was a global icon, she was a tormented child who refused to eat or speak |language=en-US |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/on-parenting/before-greta-thunberg-was-a-global-icon-she-was-a-tormented-child-who-refused-to-eat-or-speak/2020/03/16/eea2967a-63a4-11ea-acca-80c22bbee96f_story.html |access-date=2023-09-15 |issn=0190-8286 |url-access=subscription |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200317180306/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/on-parenting/before-greta-thunberg-was-a-global-icon-she-was-a-tormented-child-who-refused-to-eat-or-speak/2020/03/16/eea2967a-63a4-11ea-acca-80c22bbee96f_story.html |archive-date=17 March 2020 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the election, Thunberg spoke in front of her supporters, telling them to use their phones to film her.

Shortly after Thunberg's first school strike for the climate protest, other students engaged in similar protests in their communities. They then united and organized the school strike for climate movement under the banner of ''[[Fridays for Future]]''. After Thunberg addressed the [[2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference]], weekly student climate strike protests took place on Fridays around the world. In 2019, multiple coordinated multi-city protests involved over a million students each.&lt;ref name="NEWS-Time(2019-05-24)"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://time.com/5595365/global-climate-strikes-greta-thunberg/ |title=Students From 1,600 Cities Just Walked Out of School to Protest Climate Change.

In August 2018, Thunberg began the school climate strikes and public speeches for which she has become an internationally recognized [[climate activist]]. In an interview with [[Amy Goodman]] of ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', she said she got the idea of a climate strike after [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting|school shootings in the United States in February 2018]] led several youths to refuse to return to school.&lt;ref name="Democracy Now"&gt;{{cite interview |url=https://www.democracynow.org/2018/12/11/meet_the_15_year_old_swedish |title=School Strike for Climate: Meet 15-Year-Old Activist Greta Thunberg, Who Inspired a Global Movement |last=Thunberg |first=Greta |interviewer=[[Amy Goodman]] |website=[[Democracy Now!]] |date=11 December 2018 |access-date=22 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190717102212/https://www.democracynow.org/2018/12/11/meet_the_15_year_old_swedish |archive-date=17 July 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; These teen activists at [[Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School]] in [[Parkland, Florida]], went on to organize the [[March for Our Lives]] in support of greater [[gun control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |title=Teen activist on climate change: If we don't do anything right now, we're screwed |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGmBkIUwYkA |last=Thunberg |first=Greta |interviewer=[[Fareed Zakaria]] |agency=[[CNN]] |via=YouTube |date=23 December 2018|access-date=10 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190315172703/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGmBkIUwYkA|archive-date=15 March 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Guardian view on teenage activists: protesters not puppets |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/07/the-guardian-view-on-teenage-activists-look-whos-pulling-the-strings |access-date=11 February 2019 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=7 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190211043029/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/07/the-guardian-view-on-teenage-activists-look-whos-pulling-the-strings |archive-date=11 February 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2018, Thunberg won a climate change essay competition held by Swedish newspaper ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]''. In part, she wrote: "I want to feel safe. How can I feel safe when I know we are in the greatest crisis in human history?"&lt;ref name="NEWS-Wired(6-6-2019)" /&gt;

After the paper published her article, Thunberg was contacted by Bo Thorén from Fossil Free Dalsland, a group interested in doing something about climate change. Thunberg attended a few of their meetings. At one of them, Thorén suggested that school children could strike for climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.goodthingsguy.com/opinion/greta-thunberg/ |title=Greta Thunberg: School strike for climate and to save the world! |date=5 May 2019 |website=Good Things Guy |access-date=12 May 2019 |last=Lindeque |first=Brent |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200611001013/https://www.goodthingsguy.com/opinion/greta-thunberg/ |archive-date=11 June 2020 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunberg tried to persuade other young people to get involved but "no one was really interested", so eventually she decided to go ahead with the strike by herself.&lt;ref name="Democracy Now" /&gt;

On 20 August 2018, Thunberg, who had just started ninth grade, decided not to attend school until the [[2018 Swedish general election]] on 9 September; her protest began after the [[2018 European heat wave|heat waves]] and [[2018 Sweden wildfires|wildfires]] during Sweden's hottest summer in at least 262 years.&lt;ref name="Crouch-2018"/&gt; Her demands were that the Swedish government reduce [[carbon emissions]] in accordance with the [[Paris Agreement]], and she protested by sitting outside the [[Riksdag]] every day for three weeks during school hours with the sign ''Skolstrejk för klimatet'' ("School strike for climate").&lt;ref name="Newyorker1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-fifteen-year-old-climate-activist-who-is-demanding-a-new-kind-of-politics |title=The Fifteen-Year-Old Climate Activist Who Is Demanding a New Kind of Politics |date=2 October 2018 |newspaper=[[The New Yorker]] |last=Gessen |first=Masha |author-link=Masha Gessen |access-date=22 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190105223945/https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-fifteen-year-old-climate-activist-who-is-demanding-a-new-kind-of-politics |archive-date=5 January 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.techwarrant.com/time-person-of-the-year-is-greta-thunberg/ |title=Time Person Of The Year Is Greta Thunberg |date=12 December 2019 |newspaper=Tech Warrant |access-date=15 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191215212835/https://www.techwarrant.com/time-person-of-the-year-is-greta-thunberg/ |archive-date=15 December 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thunberg said her teachers were divided about her missing class to make her point. She says: "As people, they think what I am doing is good, but as teachers, they say I should stop."&lt;ref name="Crouch-2018"/&gt;

=== Social media activism ===
After Thunberg posted a photo of her first strike day on [[Instagram]] and Twitter, other social media accounts quickly took up her cause. High-profile [[Youth activism|youth activists]] amplified her Instagram post, and on the second day, other activists joined her. A representative of the Finnish bank [[Nordea]] quoted one of Thunberg's tweets to more than 200,000 followers. Thunberg's social media profile attracted local reporters, whose stories earned international coverage in little more than a week.&lt;ref name="wired.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/greta-thunberg-climate-crisis |first=Amelia |last=Tait |title=Greta Thunberg: How one teenager became the voice of the planet |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190823154313/https://www.wired.co.uk/article/greta-thunberg-climate-crisis |archive-date=23 August 2019 |magazine=Wired|date=6 June 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One Swedish climate-focused social media company was We Don't Have Time (WDHT), founded by Ingmar Rentzhog. He said her strike began attracting public attention only after he turned up with a freelance photographer and posted Thunberg's photograph on his Facebook page and Instagram account, and a video in English that he posted on the company's YouTube channel.&lt;ref name="TheLocal"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thelocal.se/20190209/start-up-used-child-climate-activist-to-raise-millions |title=Start-up used teen climate activist to raise millions: Swedish paper |work=[[The Local]] |date=9 February 2019 |access-date=22 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727001257/https://www.thelocal.se/20190209/start-up-used-child-climate-activist-to-raise-millions |archive-date=27 July 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rentzhog subsequently asked Thunberg to become an unpaid youth advisor to WDHT.

Throughout the autumn of 2018, Thunberg's activism evolved from a solitary protest to taking part in demonstrations throughout Europe, making several high-profile public speeches, and mobilizing her followers on social media platforms. In December, after Sweden's 2018 general election, Thunberg continued to school strike—but only on Fridays. She inspired school students across the globe to take part in her Friday school strikes. In December alone, more than 20,000 students held strikes in at least 270 cities.&lt;ref name="Guardian2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/04/leaders-like-children-school-strike-founder-greta-thunberg-tells-un-climate-summit|title='Our leaders are like children', school strike founder tells climate summit|last=Carrington|first=Damian|date=4 December 2018|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=22 July 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190102050002/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/04/leaders-like-children-school-strike-founder-greta-thunberg-tells-un-climate-summit|archive-date=2 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thunberg spoke out against the [[National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (Undergraduate)]] 2020 and [[Joint Entrance Examination]] 2020 entrance exams, which were conducted in India in September. She said it was unfair for students to have to appear for exams during a global pandemic. She also said that India's students had been deeply impacted by the floods that hit states such as [[Bihar]] and [[Assam]], which caused mass destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/news/story/conduction-of-national-exams-unfair-for-students-greta-thunberg-on-neet-jee-exams-2020-1714841-2020-08-25 |title=Deeply unfair to students: Now activist Greta Thunberg seeks postponement of JEE, NEET exams |work=[[India Today]] |access-date=25 August 2020 |archive-date=25 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200825113438/https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/news/story/conduction-of-national-exams-unfair-for-students-greta-thunberg-on-neet-jee-exams-2020-1714841-2020-08-25 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Participation at COP25 ===
Thunberg had intended to remain in the Americas to travel overland to attend the [[2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP25) originally planned in Santiago, Chile, in December. However, it was announced on short notice that COP25 was to be moved to Madrid, Spain, because of [[2019–20 Chilean protests|serious public unrest in Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-50233678 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |title=Chile cancels global climate summit amid unrest |date=30 October 2019 |access-date=31 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191031095156/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-50233678 |archive-date=31 October 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunberg has refused to fly because of the carbon emissions from air travel, so she posted on social media that she needed a ride across the Atlantic Ocean. Riley Whitelum and his wife, Elayna Carausu, two Australians who had been sailing around the world aboard their {{convert|48|ft|m|adj=on}} catamaran ''[[Sailing La Vagabonde|La Vagabonde]]'', offered to take her. So on 13 November 2019, Thunberg set sail from [[Hampton, VA|Hampton]], Virginia, for Lisbon, Portugal.

On 30 December 2019, Thunberg was [[List of Today programme guest editors|guest editor]] of the BBC Radio's flagship current affairs programme, the ''[[Today Programme]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/greta-thunberg-david-attenborough-interview-climate-change-bbc-radio-4-today-a9262261.html |author-first=Samuel |author-last=Osborne |title=Greta Thunberg to interview David Attenborough in special 'Today' show edition |date=28 December 2019 |work=The Independent |access-date=30 December 2019 |publisher=ESI Media |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191229141257/https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/greta-thunberg-david-attenborough-interview-climate-change-bbc-radio-4-today-a9262261.html |archive-date=29 December 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunberg's edition of the programme featured interviews on climate change with [[Sir David Attenborough]], [[Bank of England]] chief [[Mark Carney]], [[Massive Attack]]'s Robert Del Naja, and [[Shell Oil]] executive Maarten Wetselaar.

On 21 January 2020, Thunberg returned to the [[World Economic Forum]] held in [[Davos]], Switzerland, delivered two speeches, and participated in panel discussions hosted by ''[[The New York Times]]'' and the World Economic Forum. Thunberg used many of the themes contained in her previous speeches, but focused on one in particular: "Our house is still on fire."

In February 2020, Thunberg travelled to [[Oxford University]] to meet [[Malala Yousafzai]], a Nobel Peace Prize-winning Pakistani activist for female education who had been shot in the head by the [[Taliban]] as a schoolgirl.

On 4 March 2020, Thunberg attended an extraordinary meeting of the [[European Parliament]]'s Environment Committee to talk about the European Climate Law.

=== Post-high school graduation ===
{{proseline|section|date=December 2023}}
On 9 June 2023, Thunberg graduated high school and marked the day by attending what would ''technically'' be her last school strike for climate protest before receiving her diploma. She wore the Swedish traditional graduation white dress and white ''studentmössa'' (cap) to the protest. She vowed to continue, saying that her "fight has only just begun."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Tumin |first=Remy |date=2023-06-10 |title=Greta Thunberg Ends Her School Strikes After 251 Weeks |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/10/world/europe/greta-thunberg-graduates-activism.html |access-date=2023-09-11 |issn=0362-4331 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230612133747/https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/10/world/europe/greta-thunberg-graduates-activism.html |archive-date=12 June 2023 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2023-06-09 |title=Climate activist Greta Thunberg won't be school striking after graduation but vows to still protest |url=https://apnews.com/article/greta-thunberg-climate-graduation-protests-fridays-c60cec5b666550b9240648227649e91f |access-date=2023-09-11 |website=AP News |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231009104131/https://apnews.com/article/greta-thunberg-climate-graduation-protests-fridays-c60cec5b666550b9240648227649e91f |archive-date=9 October 2023 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Thunberg's subsequent protest pictures that she posts to her social media accounts, some of the group photos have featured "School Strike for Climate" signage.

On 19 June 2023, Thunberg took part in a Reclaim the Future protest in [[Malmö]], Sweden, and was charged with disobeying a police order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2023-07-05 |title=Greta Thunberg charged with disobeying police order at climate protest |language=en |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greta-thunberg-charged-with-disobeying-police-order-climate-protest-2023-07-05/ |access-date=2023-09-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230916125119/https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greta-thunberg-charged-with-disobeying-police-order-climate-protest-2023-07-05/ |archive-date=16 September 2023 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 July 2023, a trial was held at [[Malmö District Court]] where the prosecution presented its case against Thunberg for disobedience to authority after having disrupted traffic and refusing to follow police orders. While she acknowledged that the facts of the case against her were accurate, Thunberg said that due to the existential and global threat to the climate caused by the fossil fuel industry, her protest was a form of self-defense. She was sentenced by the court to pay fines totaling 2,500 [[Swedish krona|SEK]] (approximately US$240).&lt;ref name="defiant"&gt;{{Cite web |date=2023-07-24 |title=Greta Thunberg defiant after Swedish court fines her for disobeying police during climate protest |url=https://apnews.com/article/sweden-greta-thunberg-climate-protest-b577049479e8103037866b90efb73d19 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230929062104/https://apnews.com/article/sweden-greta-thunberg-climate-protest-b577049479e8103037866b90efb73d19 |archive-date=29 September 2023 |access-date=2023-09-15 |website=AP News |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within hours after the court convicted her, Thunberg attended a similar protest where Reclaim the Future again blocked oil tankers on a road in Malmö. She was again forcibly removed by police and later criminally charged. On 11 October 2023, Thunberg's second Swedish trial for disobedience (disobeying a police order to disperse) occurred. She was found guilty for the 24 July 2023 incident and ordered to pay fines totaling 4,500 Swedish crowns ($414).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2023-10-12 |title=Swedish court fines Greta Thunberg again for disobeying police orders |language=en |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/swedish-court-fines-greta-thunberg-again-disobeying-police-orders-2023-10-11/ |access-date=2023-10-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231012105219/https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/swedish-court-fines-greta-thunberg-again-disobeying-police-orders-2023-10-11/ |archive-date=12 October 2023 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 August 2023, Thunberg cancelled a prearranged appearance that was to occur the following Friday, 11 August, at the [[Edinburgh International Book Festival]] to promote her book: ''The Climate Book''. She said that as a climate activist she cannot attend an event sponsored by Baillie Gifford—an investment management firm—due to its connections with the fossil fuel industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Kennedy |first=Niamh |date=2023-08-04 |title=Greta Thunberg pulls out of Edinburgh Book Festival appearance after accusing key sponsor of greenwashing |url=https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/04/world/greta-thunberg-edinburgh-intl-scli-climate/index.html |access-date=2023-09-11 |website=CNN |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230810103016/https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/04/world/greta-thunberg-edinburgh-intl-scli-climate/index.html |archive-date=10 August 2023 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In making the announcement, Edinburgh International Book Festival's Nick Barley said that he was disappointed but respected Thunberg's decision. "I share Greta’s view that in all areas of society the rate of progress is not enough." He went on to say: "The book festival exists to give a platform for debate and discussion around key issues affecting humanity today - including the climate emergency . . .

[[File:Greta Thunberg at klimaatmars.jpg|thumb|Thunberg wearing a [[keffiyeh]] in solidarity of Palestine at an event in [[Amsterdam]] in 2023]]
On 20 October 2023, Thunberg posted a photo during her usual Friday climate protests, showing her and three other protesters holding signs. One sign read "climate justice now" and the other three displayed support for [[Palestinians]] in the [[Gaza Strip]] amidst the [[2023 Israel–Hamas war|2023 Israel–Hamas war.]] Her post on X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram also included fourteen links to "Palestine solidarity" social media accounts where, she suggested, "you can find information on how you can help."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Mordowanec |first=Nick |date=2023-10-20 |title=Greta Thunberg's pro-Palestine message turns heads |url=https://www.newsweek.com/greta-thunberg-pro-palestine-message-1836437 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231021073159/https://www.newsweek.com/greta-thunberg-pro-palestine-message-1836437 |archive-date=21 October 2023 |access-date=2023-10-20 |website=Newsweek |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunberg was immediately criticized for not condemning [[Hamas]]'s attack on Israel. The following day Thunberg posted "It goes without saying - or so I thought - that I’m against the horrific attacks by hamas [sic]. As I said, 'the world needs to speak up and call for an immediate ceasefire, justice and freedom for Palestinians and all civilians affected.'" The [[Ministry of Education (Israel)|Israeli Ministry of Education]] responded to Thunberg's initial "statements in support of Gaza without condemning Hamas" by removing "various references in the educational curriculum that present Thunberg as a role model and a source of inspiration for youth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Kaitlin |last=Lewis |date=2023-10-23 |title=Israel removes Greta Thunberg from curriculum over Pro-Palestinian message |url=https://www.newsweek.com/israel-removes-greta-thunberg-curriculum-over-pro-palestinian-message-1837068 |access-date=2023-10-25 |website=Newsweek |language=en |archive-date=25 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231025122552/https://www.newsweek.com/israel-removes-greta-thunberg-curriculum-over-pro-palestinian-message-1837068 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 5 December 2023, Thunberg and three researcher/activists affiliated with Fridays for Future Sweden published an opinion piece in ''The Guardian'' to clarify her and FFF Sweden's support for Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip amidst the 2023 Israel–Hamas war.

=== Politicians ===
Thunberg has met with many politicians and world leaders but said she could not think of a single politician who has impressed her. Asked about New Zealand prime minister [[Jacinda Ardern]], who described the climate crisis as a matter of life or death, Thunberg commented, "It's funny that people believe Jacinda Ardern and people like that are climate leaders. That just tells you how little people know about the climate crisis." Thunberg says that she ignores words and sentiments: "Obviously the emissions haven't fallen. It goes without saying that these people are not doing anything." In fact, New Zealand's greenhouse-gas emissions had increased by 2% in 2019.&lt;ref name="Hattenstone-2021" /&gt;

[[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] [[António Guterres]] endorsed the school strikes initiated by Thunberg, admitting: "My generation has failed to respond properly to the dramatic challenge of climate change.

In September 2019, Trump shared a video of Thunberg angrily addressing world leaders, along with her quote that "people are dying, entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a [[Holocene extinction|mass extinction]]." Trump wrote about Thunberg, tweeting: "She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!" Thunberg reacted by changing her Twitter bio to match his description, and stating that she could not "understand why grown-ups would choose to mock children and teenagers for just communicating and acting on the science when they could do something good instead."&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources:

=== "The Greta effect" ===
[[File:GrèveClimatGenève-27sept2019-041-RuesBasses.jpg|thumb|left|[[September 2019 climate strike]] in Geneva]]
In summarizing Thunberg's global impact on the climate debate, the BBC encapsulated her influence: "she is credited with raising public awareness of climate change across the world, especially amongst young people. Many commentators call this 'the Greta effect'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2019-11-29 |title=Greta Thunberg: Who is the climate activist and what has she achieved? |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-49918719 |access-date=2023-10-26 |archive-date=25 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231025203704/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-49918719 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to her outspoken stance, various politicians have also acknowledged the need to focus on climate change. Britain's secretary for the environment, [[Michael Gove]], said, "When I listened to you, I felt great admiration, but also responsibility and guilt. I am of your parents' generation, and I recognise that we haven't done nearly enough to address climate change and the broader environmental crisis that we helped to create." Labour politician [[Ed Miliband]], who was responsible for introducing the [[Climate Change Act 2008]], said, "You have woken us up. Thank you. All the young people who have gone on strike have held up a mirror to our society ... you have taught us all a really important lesson. You have stood out from the crowd."&lt;ref name="NEWS-Guardian(2019-04-23)" /&gt;
