She is the author of ''[[No Logo]]'' ([[2000]]), which became a [[manifesto]] of the [[anti-globalization movement]].  She is also the author of ''Fences and Windows'' ([[2002]]). She also writes for [[The Nation]], [[In These Times]], [[Canada]]'s ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', and ''[[The Guardian]]'' in Britain.

Her book ''[[No Logo]]'' was one of the first publications to receive feedback from [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], a company she oft-criticises throughout the book.
