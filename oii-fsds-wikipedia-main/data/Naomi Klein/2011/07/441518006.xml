'''Naomi Klein''' (born May 8, 1970) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[author]] and [[Activism|social activist]] known for her political analyses and [[anti-globalisation|criticism of corporate globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=10110 |title=The Shock Doctrine |author=Chris Nineham |date=October 2007 |accessdate=April 25, 2011 |work=[[Socialist Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Klein was born in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] and brought up in a [[Jew]]ish family with a history of [[peace]] activism. Her parents had moved to Montreal from the U.S. in 1967 as [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|war resisters]] to the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="doc_townhall"/&gt;  Her mother, documentary [[film-maker]] [[Bonnie Sherr Klein]], is best known for her [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography]] film ''[[Not a Love Story]]''.&lt;ref name="bonnie_sherr_klein_bio" /&gt; Her father, Michael Klein, is a physician and a member of [[Physicians for Social Responsibility]]. Her brother, Seth Klein, is director of the [[British Columbia]] office of the [[Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives]].

Her paternal grandparents were communists who began to turn against the [[Soviet Union]] after the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] and had abandoned [[communism]] by 1956. In 1942 her grandfather Phil Klein, an animator at [[Disney]], was fired after the [[Disney animators' strike]],&lt;ref name="tom_sito_disney"/&gt; and went to work at a shipyard instead. Klein's father grew up surrounded by ideas of [[social justice]] and [[racial equality]], but found it "difficult and frightening to be the child of Communists", a so-called [[red diaper baby]].&lt;ref name="nyer"/&gt;

Klein's husband, [[Avi Lewis]], works as a TV journalist and documentary filmmaker. His parents are the writer and activist [[Michele Landsberg]] and politician and diplomat [[Stephen Lewis]], son of [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]], one of the founders of the Canadian [[New Democratic Party]], son in turn of [[Moishe Lewis]], born Losz, a Jewish labour activist of "[[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|the Bund]]" who left [[Eastern Europe]] for Canada in 1921.&lt;ref name="avi_lewis_cbc"/&gt;

Klein and her husband live in [[Toronto]].

==Early life==
Klein spent much of her teenage years in [[shopping mall]]s, obsessed with designer logos.&lt;ref name="Hand-to-Brand"/&gt; As a child and teenager, she found it "very oppressive to have a very public feminist mother" and she rejected politics, instead embracing "full-on [[consumerism]]."

She has attributed her change in worldview to two events. One was when she was 17 and preparing for the [[University of Toronto]], her mother had a stroke and became severely disabled.&lt;ref name="abilities"/&gt; Naomi, her father and brother took care of Bonnie through the period in hospital and at home, making educational sacrifices to do so.&lt;ref name="abilities"/&gt; That year off prevented her "from being such a brat."&lt;ref name="Hand-to-Brand"/&gt;  The next year, after beginning her studies at the [[University of Toronto]], the second event occurred: the 1989 [[École Polytechnique massacre]] of female engineering students, which proved to be a wake-up call to [[feminism]].&lt;ref name="montreal-massacre"/&gt;

Klein's writing career started with contributions to ''[[The Varsity (newspaper)|The Varsity]]'', a student newspaper, where she served as editor-in-chief.  After her third year at the University of Toronto, she dropped out of university to take a job at the ''[[Toronto Globe and Mail]]'', followed by an editorship at ''[[This Magazine]]'', the Canadian equivalent of the American magazine ''[[The Nation]]''.&lt;ref name="nyer"/&gt; In 1995, she returned to the University of Toronto to finish her degree&lt;ref name="nyer"/&gt; but left the university for a journalism internship before acquiring the final credits required to complete her degree.&lt;ref&gt;Q&amp;A Interview with Brian Lamb, on CSPAN, dated November 29, 2009, [http://www.q-and-a.org/Program/index.asp?ProgramID=1260 Klein Q&amp;A interview and transcript]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career as an author==
===No Logo===

{{Main|No Logo}}
In 2000, Klein published the book ''[[No Logo]]'', which for many became a [[manifesto]] of the [[anti-globalization|anti-corporate globalization movement]]. In it, she attacks [[brand name|brand]]-oriented [[consumer culture]] by describing the operations of large [[corporation]]s. She also accuses several such corporations of unethically exploiting workers in the world's poorest countries in pursuit of greater profits. In this book, Klein criticized [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] so severely that Nike published a point-by-point response.&lt;ref name="no-logo-nike"/&gt; ''No Logo'' became an international bestseller, selling over one million copies in over 28 languages.&lt;ref name="Nation-bio"/&gt;

===Fences and Windows===

{{Main|Fences and Windows}}
In 2002 Klein published ''[[Fences and Windows]]'', a collection of her articles and speeches written on behalf of the [[anti-globalization movement]] (all proceeds from the book go to benefit activist organizations through The Fences and Windows Fund). Klein also contributes to ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', ''[[In These Times]]'', ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', ''[[This Magazine]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', and ''[[The Guardian]]''.

===Iraq war criticism===

Klein has written on various current issues, such as the [[Iraq War]]. In a September 2004 article for ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'',&lt;ref name="Harpers"/&gt; she argues that, contrary to popular belief, the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] did have a clear plan for post-invasion Iraq, which was to build a completely unconstrained [[free market economics|free market economy]]. She describes plans to allow foreigners to extract wealth from Iraq, and the methods used to achieve those goals.&lt;ref name="Democracy-Now"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt; The 2008 film ''[[War, Inc.]]'' was partially inspired by her article, ''Baghdad Year Zero''.&lt;ref name="film.guardian"/&gt;

Klein's August 2004 "Bring Najaf to New York", published in ''The Nation'', argued that [[Muqtada Al Sadr]]'s [[Mahdi Army]] "represents the overwhelmingly mainstream sentiment in Iraq."&lt;ref name="Najif-Nation"/&gt; She went on to say "Yes, if elected Sadr would try to turn Iraq into a theocracy like Iran, but for now his demands are for direct elections and an end to foreign occupation".&lt;ref name="Najif-Nation"/&gt; [[Marc Cooper]], a former ''Nation'' columnist, attacked the assertion that Al Sadr represented mainstream Iraqi sentiment and that American forces had brought the fight to the holy city of Najaf.&lt;ref name="MarcCooper"/&gt; Cooper wrote that "Klein should know better. All enemies of the U.S. occupation she opposes are not her friends. Or ours. Or those of the Iraqi people. I don’t think that Mullah Al Sadr, in any case, is much desirous of support issuing from secular Jewish feminist-socialists."&lt;ref name = "MarcCooper"/&gt;

===The Take===

{{Main|The Take (2004 film)}}
In 2004, Klein and her husband, [[Avi Lewis]], released a [[documentary film]] called ''[[The Take (2004 film)|The Take]]'' about factory workers in [[Argentina]] who [[recovered factory|took over a closed plant]] and resumed production, operating as a [[collective]]. The first African screening was in the Kennedy Road shack settlement in the South African city of [[Durban]], where the [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] movement began.&lt;ref name="Phillips-Fein"/&gt;

At least one article in ''[[Z Communications]]'' criticized ''The Take'' for its portrayal of the Argentine General and politician [[Juan Domingo Peron]], which they felt portrayed him as a social democrat.&lt;ref name="the_take"/&gt;

===The Shock Doctrine===

{{Main|The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism}}
Klein's third book, ''The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism'', was published on September 4, 2007, becoming an international and [[New York Times bestseller]]&lt;ref name="Nation-bio"/&gt; translated into 28 languages.&lt;ref name="RandomHouse"/&gt;  The book argues that the free market policies of Nobel Laureate [[Milton Friedman]] and the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School of Economics]] have risen to prominence in countries such as [[Chile under Pinochet]], [[Economy of Russia|Russia under Yeltsin]], and the United States (for example, the privatization of the [[New Orleans Public Schools]] after [[Hurricane Katrina]]). The book also argues that policy initiatives such as the privatization of Iraq's economy under the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] were pushed through while the citizens of these countries were in shock from disasters or upheavals. It is also claimed that these shocks are in some cases, such as the [[Falklands War]], created with the intention of being able to push through these unpopular reforms in the wake of the crisis.  Klein identifies  "shock doctrine", elaborating on [[Joseph Schumpeter]], as the latest in capitalism's phases of "creative destruction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/cockburn09222007.html|title=On Naomi Klein's "The Shock Doctrine"|publisher=[[CounterPunch]]|author=Alexander Cockburn|date=September 22 / 23, 2007|authorlink=Alexander Cockburn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Shock Doctrine'' was adapted into a [[short film]] of the same name, released onto [[YouTube]]. The film was directed by Jonás Cuarón, produced and co-written by his father [[Alfonso Cuarón]]. The video has been viewed over one million times.&lt;ref name="Nation-bio"/&gt;

Among positive reviews, [[Joseph Stiglitz]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that ''The Shock Doctrine'' is an "ambitious look at the economic history of the last 50 years and the rise of free-market fundamentalism around the world," then added that
Klein is "not an academic and cannot be judged as one"; John Gray, reviewing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', describes the book as "both timely and devastating".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/sep/15/politics|author=John Gray|publisher=The Guardian|title=The end of the world as we know it|date=15 September 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/books/review/Stiglitz-t.html|title=Bleakonomics|publisher=The New York Times|date=September 30, 2007 | first=Joseph E. | last=Stiglitz | accessdate=May 19, 2010}}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Among negative reviews, in a report for ''[[Cato Institute]]'', [[Johan Norberg]] wrote that Klein's analysis is "flawed on virtually every level" and her historical examples do not survive scrutiny.&lt;ref name="norberg_disaster_polemics"/&gt; Tom Redburn, in ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote "she essentially accuses Friedman of being the godfather of a Mafia-like gang ... There’s a measure of truth about the dark side of globalization ... but [corporatism] is a lot to lay on poor Milton." He also wrote that Klein incorrectly grouped [[neoconservatives]] with [[neoliberals]] like [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; In ''[[The Times]]'', Cole characterized ''The Shock Doctrine'' as "lucidly written and comprehensively researched" but also criticized it as "lean[ing] heavily on partisan contributions from the cuttings library and the blogosphere."&lt;ref name="cole_times"/&gt; [[Jonathan Chait]], senior editor of ''The New Republic'', criticized Klein for repeatedly ignoring when the facts contradict her arguments ("But in full defiance of everything that we know about post-war Iraq, Klein proceeds to argue that what might superficially appear to be a total failure is, in fact, the successful culmination of the war's purposes").&lt;ref name="chait_new_republic"/&gt;

Other reviews of the book included the [[Los Angeles Times]], which said, "...Klein launches a highly polemical, and persuasive, assault on free-market fundamentalism."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/features/books/la-bkw-rayner22-2008jun22,1,625596.story?page=2&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[The Washington Post]] published a mixed review written by [[Shashi Tharoor]] which said, "Despite its limitations, The Shock Doctrine is a valuable addition to the corpus of popular books that have attempted to rethink the big ideas of our post-Cold War age." At points, Klein is accused of being "palpably unfair" and "too ready to see conspiracies", but the review concludes that the book: "...contributes to the contest of ideas about the shape and direction of our current Age of Uncertainty. For this reason, and for the vigor and accessibility with which she marshals her argument, Naomi Klein is well worth reading."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/21/AR2007112101919.html?nav=hcmodule&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of ''The Shock Doctrine'' increased Klein's prominence, with the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' judging her "the most visible and influential figure on the American left—what [[Howard Zinn]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] were thirty years ago." On February 24, 2009, the book was awarded the inaugural [[Warwick Prize for Writing]] from the [[University of Warwick]] in England. The prize carried a cash award of £50,000.

===Criticism of Israeli policies===

In March 2008, Klein was the keynote speaker at the first national conference of the [[Independent Jewish Voices (Canada)|Alliance of Concerned Jewish Canadians]].  In January 2009, during the [[Gaza War]], Klein supported the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] (BDS) campaign against [[Israel]], arguing that "the best strategy to end the increasingly bloody occupation is for Israel to become the target of the kind of global movement that put an end to apartheid in South Africa."&lt;ref name="time-for-boycott"/&gt;

In summer 2009, on the occasion of the publication of the [[Hebrew]] translation of her book ''The Shock Doctrine'', Klein visited Israel, the [[West Bank]], and [[Gaza]], combining the promotion of her book and the BDS campaign. In an interview to the Israeli newspaper ''[[Ha'aretz]]'' she emphasized that it is important to her "not to boycott Israelis but rather to boycott the normalization of Israel and the conflict."&lt;ref name="klein_haaretz"/&gt; In a speech in [[Ramallah]] on the 27th of June, she apologized to the [[Palestinians]] for not joining the BDS campaign earlier.&lt;ref name="klein_ramallah"/&gt; Her remarks, particularly that "[Some Jews] even think we get one get-away-with-genocide-free-card" were characterized by an op-ed columnist in the ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' as "violent" and "unethical," and as the "most perverse of aspersions on Jews, an age-old stereotype of Jews as intrinsically evil and malicious."&lt;ref name="schimmel"/&gt;

Klein was also a spokesperson for the protest against the [[2009 Toronto International Film Festival#Controversy over Tel Aviv spotlight|spotlight on Tel Aviv]] at the [[2009 Toronto International Film Festival]], a spotlight that Klein said was a very selective and misleading portrait of Israel.&lt;ref name="globe_and_mail"/&gt;

==Other activities==
Klein once lectured as a Miliband Fellow at the [[London School of Economics]] as an award-winning journalist, writer on the anti-globalisation movement.&lt;ref name="lse"/&gt;

Klein ranked 11th in an internet poll of the [[The 2005 Global Intellectuals Poll|top global intellectuals of 2005]], a list of the world's top 100 public intellectuals compiled by the ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]'' magazine in conjunction with ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="globe_poll"/&gt;

Klein was involved in a protest condemning police action during the G20 summit in Toronto, ON. She spoke to a rally seeking the release of protesters in front of police headquarters on June 28, 2010.&lt;ref name="Rabble"/&gt;

In May 2011, Klein received an honourary degree from [[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)|Saint Thomas University]].
