'''Greta Tintin Eleonora Ernman Thunberg''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRSGS}} ({{IPA-sv|ˈɡrêːta ˈtʉ̂ːnbærj|lang|Sv-Greta Thunberg.ogg}}; born 3 January 2003) is a Swedish [[Environmental movement|environmental activist]] who has gained international recognition for promoting the view that humanity is facing an existential crisis arising from [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-48018034/climate-change-activist-greta-thunberg-listen-to-climate-scientists 'It's an existential crisis.

Thunberg's activism started after convincing her parents to adopt several [[Individual action on climate change|lifestyle choices]] to reduce their own [[carbon footprint]]. In August 2018, at age 15, she started spending her school days outside the [[Swedish parliament]] to call for stronger [[Climate change mitigation|action on climate change]] by holding up a sign reading ''{{lang|se|Skolstrejk för klimatet}}'' ([[School strike for climate]]). Soon, other students engaged in similar protests in their own communities. Together, they organised a [[school climate strike]] movement under the name ''Fridays for Future''. After Thunberg addressed the [[2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference]], student strikes took place every week somewhere in the world. In 2019, there were multiple coordinated multi-city protests involving over a million students each.&lt;ref name="NEWS-Time(2019-05-24)"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://time.com/5595365/global-climate-strikes-greta-thunberg/ |title=Students From 1,600 Cities Just Walked Out of School to Protest Climate Change.

Thunberg says she first heard about climate change in 2011, when she was eight years old, and could not understand why so little was being done about it.&lt;ref name="YouTube-Thunberg(2018-11-24)"&gt;{{cite AV media |first=Greta |last=Thunberg |date=24 November 2018 |title=School strike for climate – save the world by changing the rules |publisher=TEDxStockholm |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAmmUIEsN9A&amp;t=1m46s |access-date=29 January 2019 |time=1:46 |via=[[YouTube]] |quote=I was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, OCD, and selective mutism.

Interviewed in December 2019 by the [[BBC]], her father said his wife stopped flying to try to 'save' their daughter rather than the climate. He added: "To be honest, (her mother) didn't do it to save the climate. She did it to save her child because she saw how much it meant to her, and then, when she did that, she saw how much (Greta) grew from that, how much energy she got from it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dominic |last=McGrath |accessdate=4 January 2020 |url=https://www.thejournal.ie/greta-thunberg-climate-strike-dad-4949862-Dec2019/ |title='We thought it was a bad idea': Greta Thunberg's dad says he was worried about her climate activism. |work=Thejournal.ie |date=31 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191231205515/https://www.thejournal.ie/greta-thunberg-climate-strike-dad-4949862-Dec2019/ |archive-date=31 December 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Amy Goodman]] from ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', she said she first got the idea of a climate strike after [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting|school shootings in the United States in February 2018]] led to several youths refusing to go back to school.&lt;ref name="Democracy Now"&gt;{{cite interview |url=https://www.democracynow.org/2018/12/11/meet_the_15_year_old_swedish |title=School Strike for Climate: Meet 15-Year-Old Activist Greta Thunberg, Who Inspired a Global Movement |last=Thunberg |first=Greta |interviewer=[[Amy Goodman]] |website=[[Democracy Now!]] |date=11 December 2018 |accessdate=22 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190717102212/https://www.democracynow.org/2018/12/11/meet_the_15_year_old_swedish |archive-date=17 July 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; These teen activists at [[Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School]] in [[Parkland, Florida]], went on to organise the [[March for Our Lives]] in support of greater [[gun control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |title=Teen activist on climate change: If we don't do anything right now, we're screwed |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGmBkIUwYkA |last=Thunberg |first=Greta |interviewer=[[Fareed Zakaria]] |agency=[[CNN]] |via=YouTube |date=23 December 2018|access-date=10 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190315172703/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGmBkIUwYkA|archive-date=15 March 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Guardian view on teenage activists: protesters not puppets |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/07/the-guardian-view-on-teenage-activists-look-whos-pulling-the-strings |access-date=11 February 2019 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=7 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190211043029/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/07/the-guardian-view-on-teenage-activists-look-whos-pulling-the-strings |archive-date=11 February 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2018, Thunberg won a climate change essay competition held by Swedish newspaper ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]''. In part, she wrote "I want to feel safe. How can I feel safe when I know we are in the greatest crisis in human history?”&lt;ref name="NEWS-Wired(6-6-2019)" /&gt;

After the paper published her article, she was contacted by Bo Thorén from Fossil Free Dalsland, a group interested in doing something about climate change. Thunberg attended a few of their meetings. At one of them, Thorén suggested that school children could strike for climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.goodthingsguy.com/opinion/greta-thunberg/ |title=Greta Thunberg: School strike for climate and to save the world! |date=5 May 2019 |website=Good Things Guy |access-date=12 May 2019 |last=Lindeque |first=Brent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunberg tried to persuade other young people to get involved but "no one was really interested", so eventually she decided to go ahead with the strike by herself.&lt;ref name="Democracy Now" /&gt;

On 20 August 2018, Thunberg, who had just started ninth grade, decided not to attend school until the [[2018 Swedish general election]] on 9 September; her protest began after the [[2018 European heat wave|heat waves]] and [[2018 Sweden wildfires|wildfires]] during Sweden's hottest summer in at least 262 years.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Her demands were that the Swedish government reduce carbon emissions in accordance with the [[Paris Agreement]], and she protested by sitting outside the [[Riksdag]] every day for three weeks during school hours with the sign ''Skolstrejk för klimatet'' (school strike for climate).&lt;ref name="Newyorker1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-fifteen-year-old-climate-activist-who-is-demanding-a-new-kind-of-politics |title=The Fifteen-Year-Old Climate Activist Who Is Demanding a New Kind of Politics |date=2 October 2018 |newspaper=[[The New Yorker]] |last=Gessen |first=Masha |authorlink=Masha Gessen |accessdate=22 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190105223945/https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-fifteen-year-old-climate-activist-who-is-demanding-a-new-kind-of-politics |archive-date=5 January 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.techwarrant.com/time-person-of-the-year-is-greta-thunberg/ |title=Time Person Of The Year Is Greta Thunberg |date=12 December 2019 |newspaper=Tech Warrant |accessdate=15 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191215212835/https://www.techwarrant.com/time-person-of-the-year-is-greta-thunberg/ |archive-date=15 December 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thunberg said her teachers were divided in their views about her missing class to make her point. She says: "As people they think what I am doing is good, but as teachers they say I should stop."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==== Social media activism ====
Thunberg posted a photo of her first strike day on [[Instagram]] and Twitter, with other social media accounts quickly taking up her cause.&lt;ref name="wired.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/greta-thunberg-climate-crisis |first=Amelia |last=Tait |title=Greta Thunberg: How one teenager became the voice of the planet |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190823154313/https://www.wired.co.uk/article/greta-thunberg-climate-crisis |archive-date=23 August 2019 |work=Wired|date=6 June 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; High-profile youth activists amplified her Instagram post, and on the second day she was joined by other activists.&lt;ref name="wired.co.uk"/&gt; A representative of the Finnish bank [[Nordea]] quoted one of Thunberg's tweets to more than 200,000 followers. Thunberg's social media profile attracted local reporters whose stories earned international coverage in little more than a week.&lt;ref name="wired.co.uk" /&gt;

One Swedish climate-focused social media company was ''We Don't Have Time'' (WDHT), founded by Ingmar Rentzhog. He claimed her strike only began attracting public attention after he turned up with a freelance photographer and posted Thunberg's photograph on his Facebook page and Instagram account, and a video in English that he posted on the company's YouTube channel.&lt;ref name="TheLocal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thelocal.se/20190209/start-up-used-child-climate-activist-to-raise-millions |title=Start-up used teen climate activist to raise millions: Swedish paper |newspaper=[[The Local]] |date=9 February 2019 |accessdate=22 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727001257/https://www.thelocal.se/20190209/start-up-used-child-climate-activist-to-raise-millions |archive-date=27 July 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rentzhog subsequently asked Thunberg to become an unpaid youth advisor to WDHT. He then used her name and image without her knowledge or permission to raise millions for a WDHT for-profit subsidiary, ''We Don't Have Time AB'', of which Rentzhog is the chief executive officer.&lt;ref name="Politico-Feb11"&gt;{{cite news |last=Oroschakoff |first=Kalina |title=Teen climate icon used for fundraising without her knowledge |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/greta-thunberg-teen-climate-icon-used-for-fundraising-without-her-knowledge/ |work=[[Politico Europe]] |date=11 February 2019 |accessdate=22 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702172521/https://www.politico.eu/article/greta-thunberg-teen-climate-icon-used-for-fundraising-without-her-knowledge/ |archive-date=2 July 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunberg received no money from the company&lt;ref name="TheLocal"/&gt; and terminated her volunteer advisor role with WDHT once she realised they were making money from her name.&lt;ref name="GretaFeb2Facebook"&gt;{{cite web |last=Thunberg |first=Greta |title=Recently I've seen many rumors… |url=https://www.facebook.com/732846497083173/posts/767646880269801/ |via=[[Facebook]] |access-date=15 February 2019 |date=2 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190212223859/https://www.facebook.com/732846497083173/posts/767646880269801/ |archive-date=12 February 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After October 2018, Thunberg's activism evolved from solitary protesting to taking part in demonstrations throughout Europe; making several high-profile public speeches, and mobilising her growing number of followers on [[social media]] platforms. After the December 2018 general elections, Thunberg continued to strike only on Fridays. She inspired school students across the globe to take part in student strikes. That month, more than 20,000 students had held strikes in at least 270 cities.&lt;ref name="Guardian2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/04/leaders-like-children-school-strike-founder-greta-thunberg-tells-un-climate-summit|title='Our leaders are like children', school strike founder tells climate summit|last=Carrington|first=Damian|date=4 December 2018|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=22 July 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190102050002/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/04/leaders-like-children-school-strike-founder-greta-thunberg-tells-un-climate-summit|archive-date=2 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Protests and speeches in Europe ====
{{Further|Speeches of Greta Thunberg}}
Her speech during the plenary session of the [[2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP24) went viral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2019/06/07/730383662/greta-thunberg-are-we-running-out-of-time-to-save-our-planet|title=Greta Thunberg: Are We Running Out Of Time To Save Our Planet?|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2020-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; She commented that the world leaders present were "not mature enough to tell it like it is".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/16/world/greta-thunberg-cop24/index.html|title=Teen tells climate negotiators they aren't mature enough|author1=John Sutter|author2=Lawrence Davidson|website=CNN|access-date=2020-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of 2019 she joined various student protests around Europe, and was invited to speak at various forums and parliaments.

==== Participation at COP25 ====
Thunberg had intended to remain in the Americas to travel overland to attend the [[2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP25) originally planned in Santiago, Chile in December. However, it was announced on short notice that COP25 was to be moved to Madrid, Spain, because of [[2019–20 Chilean protests|serious public unrest in Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-50233678 |work=BBC News |title=Chile cancels global climate summit amid unrest |date=30 October 2019 |access-date=31 October 2019 |language=en-GB |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191031095156/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-50233678 |archive-date=31 October 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunberg has refused to fly because of the carbon emissions from air travel, so she posted on social media that she needed a ride across the Atlantic Ocean. Riley Whitelum and his wife, Elayna Carausu, two Australians who had been sailing around the world aboard their {{convert|48|ft|m|adj=on}} catamaran, ''[[Sailing La Vagabonde|La Vagabonde]]'', offered to take her. So, on 13 November 2019, Thunberg set sail from [[Hampton, VA|Hampton]], Virginia, for Lisbon, Portugal. Her departing message was the same as it has been since she began her activism: "My message to the Americans is the same as to everyone – that is to unite behind the science and to act on the science."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/climate/greta-thunberg-return-europe.html |title=Greta Thunberg Sets Sail, Again, After Climate Talks Relocate |last=Sengupta |first=Somini |date=12 November 2019 |work=The New York Times|access-date=14 November 2019 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191114072255/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/climate/greta-thunberg-return-europe.html|archive-date=14 November 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-13/australian-sailors-taking-greta-thunberg-back-to-un-cop25-summit/11699990 |title=Australian sailing couple and their son come to Greta Thunberg's rescue |last=Shine |first=Rhiannon |last2=Carmody |first2=James |date=13 November 2019 |website=ABC News |language=en-AU|access-date=14 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191114014102/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-13/australian-sailors-taking-greta-thunberg-back-to-un-cop25-summit/11699990|archive-date=14 November 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/12/greta-thunberg-climate-crisis-message-vote |title=Greta Thunberg leaves US with simple climate crisis message: vote |last=Holden |first=Emily |date=12 November 2019 |work=The Guardian|access-date=14 November 2019 |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191114103555/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/12/greta-thunberg-climate-crisis-message-vote|archive-date=14 November 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 December 2019 Thunberg was [[List of Today programme guest editors|guest editor]] of the BBC Radio's flagship current affairs programme, the ''[[Today Programme]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/greta-thunberg-david-attenborough-interview-climate-change-bbc-radio-4-today-a9262261.html|author=Samuel Osborne|title=Greta Thunberg to interview David Attenborough in special 'Today' show edition|date=28 December 2019|work=The Independent|access-date=30 December 2019|publisher=ESI Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunberg's edition of the programme featured interviews on climate change with Sir David Attenborough, Bank of England chief [[Mark Carney]], [[Massive Attack]]’s Robert Del Naja, and [[Shell Oil]] executive Maarten Wetselaar. The BBC subsequently released a podcast&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07z5h48|title=BBC Radio 4 – Best of Today, Today guest edits: Greta Thunberg|website=BBC|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing these interviews and other highlights. On 11 January 2020 Thunberg called on German company [[Siemens]] to stop the delivery of railway equipment to the controversial [[Carmichael coal mine]] operated by a subsidiary of Indian company [[Adani Group]] in Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.faz.net/1.6576039|title=Bau Australien: Greta Thunberg fordert Siemens zur Aufgabe von Kohle-Projekt auf|journal=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|access-date=2020-01-12|language=de|issn=0174-4909}}&lt;/ref&gt; but on 13 January Siemens said that it would continue to honour its contract with Adani.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/13/adani-coalmine-siemens-ceo-has-empathy-for-environment-but-will-honour-contract|title=Adani coalmine: Siemens CEO has 'empathy' for environment but refuses to quit contract|last=Readfearn|first=Graham|date=2020-01-13|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-13|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 January 2020, Thunberg returned to the [[World Economic Forum]] held in Davos, Switzerland, delivered two speeches, and participated in panel discussions hosted by ''[[The New York Times]]'' and the World Economic Forum. Thunberg used many of the themes contained in her previous speeches, but focused on one in particular: "Our house is still on fire." Thunberg joked that she cannot complain about not being heard, saying: "I am being heard all the time." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/climate/greta-thunberg-davos.html|title=Greta Thunberg's Message at Davos Forum: 'Our House Is Still on Fire'|last=Sengupta|first=Somini|date=2020-01-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-01-21|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/21/greta-thunberg-calls-on-world-leaders-to-heed-global-heating-science-davos|title=Greta Thunberg tells leaders at Davos to heed global heating science|last=Elliott|first=Larry|date=2020-01-21|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-21|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/5768561/greta-thunberg-davos-panel-time/|title=Thunberg at TIME Panel: 'Pretty Much Nothing Has Been Done' on Climate|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2020-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 March 2020, Thunberg attended an extraordinary meeting of the European Parliament’s Environment Committee to talk about the European Climate Law. There she declared that she considered the new proposal for a climate law published by the European Commission to be a surrender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite media release |url=https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20200304IPR73905/greta-thunberg-to-meps-we-will-not-allow-you-to-surrender-our-future |title=Greta Thunberg to MEPs: “we will not allow you to surrender our future” |work=[[European Parliament]] |date=4 March 2020 |accessdate=5 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital activism==
Following the [[coronavirus]], in March 2020 Greta Thunberg encouraged the movement to instead of gathering at the streets and town squares, sit at home with a sign and post the image on the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/how-greta-thunberg-transformed-existential-dread-into-a-movement|title=How Greta Thunberg Transformed Existential Dread Into a Movement|publisher=New Yorker|language=English|author=Emily Witt|date=6 April 2020|accessdate=12 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thunberg has pointed out that climate change will have a disproportionate effect on young people whose futures will be profoundly affected. She argues that her generation may not have a future any more, because "that future was sold so that a small number of people could make unimaginable amounts of money".&lt;ref name="Guardian MPS Speech"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/23/greta-thunberg-full-speech-to-mps-you-did-not-act-in-time|title='You did not act in time': Greta Thunberg's full speech to MPs|last=Thunberg|first=Greta|date=23 April 2019|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=31 August 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190831214211/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/23/greta-thunberg-full-speech-to-mps-you-did-not-act-in-time|archive-date=31 August 2019|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also has made the point that people in the [[Global South]] will suffer most from climate change, even though they have contributed least in terms of carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/06/07/challenging-us-all-confront-realities-climate-crisis-greta-thunberg-and-fridays|title=For 'Challenging Us All to Confront the Realities of the Climate Crisis,' Greta Thunberg and Fridays for Future Movement Win Amnesty's Top Human Rights Award|last=Johnson|first=Jake|date=7 June 2019|website=Common Dreams|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thunberg has voiced support for other young activists from developing countries who are already facing the damaging effects of climate change.

More specifically, Thunberg has argued that commitments made at the Paris Agreement are insufficient to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, and that the greenhouse gas emissions curve needs to start declining steeply no later than 2020—as detailed in the IPCC's [[Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C|2018 Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5° C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/07/29/deliver-fundamental-message-survival-future-generations-greta-thunberg-sail-atlantic|title=To Deliver 'Fundamental Message' for 'Survival of Future Generations,' Greta Thunberg to Sail Atlantic for Americas|last=Germanos|first=Andrea|date=29 July 2019|website=Common Dreams|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190831085522/https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/07/29/deliver-fundamental-message-survival-future-generations-greta-thunberg-sail-atlantic|archive-date=31 August 2019|access-date=31 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian MPS Speech" /&gt; In February 2019, at a conference of the [[European Economic and Social Committee]], she said that the EU's current intention to cut emissions by 40% by 2030 is "not sufficient to protect the future for children growing up today" and that the [[European Union|EU]] must reduce their {{CO2}} emissions by 80%, double the 40% goal.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/climate-activist-thunberg-urges-eu-double-carbon-reduction-111042030.html|title=Climate activist Thunberg urges EU to double carbon reduction targets|last=Carmichael|first=Lachlan|date=22 February 2019|access-date=22 February 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190221172831/https://news.yahoo.com/climate-activist-thunberg-urges-eu-double-carbon-reduction-111042030.html|archive-date=21 February 2019|agency=Agence France-Presse|via=Yahoo!

=== Position on COVID-19 ===

Thunberg stated that she believes she caught [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] during the [[2019–20 coronavirus pandemic|2019–2020 coronavirus pandemic]] in March 2020, but only suffered mild symptoms. She said that everyone must fight the climate crisis and coronavirus pandemic simultaneously and not allow the health crisis to delay action on cutting carbon emissions. In an interview during a [[New Scientist]] podcast, she said a collective decision was taken at an emergency remote meeting of the [[Fridays for Future]] movement to conduct virtual protests during the pandemic. Thunberg added “If one virus can wipe out the entire economy in a matter of weeks and shut down societies, then that is a proof that our societies are not very resilient. It also shows that once we are in an emergency, we can act and we can change our behaviour quickly.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2238831-greta-we-must-fight-the-climate-crisis-and-pandemic-simultaneously/|title=Greta: We must fight the climate crisis and pandemic simultaneously|work=New Scientist|last=Vaughan|first=Adam|date=March 30, 2020|accessdate=2 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking at a virtual meeting on YouTube to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpQd1PNLL5k Greta Thunberg holds digital conversation on Earth Day], YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; Thunberg said the global response to the coronavirus demonstrated how quickly change can happen when humanity acts on the advice of scientists adding that the same urgency should be applied to the climate crisis. She noted: "If one single virus can destroy economies in a couple of weeks, it shows we are not thinking long-term and taking risks into account... We have to adapt. That is what you have to do in a crisis.”&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/22/earth-day-greta-thunberg-calls-for-new-path-after-pandemic Earth Day: Greta Thunberg calls for 'new path' after pandemic], The Guardian, 22 April 2020&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2019, Vladimir Putin described Thunberg as a "kind girl and very sincere", while suggesting she was being manipulated to serve others' interests. Putin criticised her as "poorly informed": "No one has explained to Greta that the modern world is complex and different and people in Africa or in many Asian countries want to live at the same wealth level as in Sweden." Similar to her reaction to Trump, Thunberg updated her Twitter bio to reflect Putin's description of her.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources:

Over and over again. It is shameful that the world remains silent about this". When asked about this subject two days later, Brazilian president [[Jair Bolsonaro]] responded: "Greta said that the Indians were dying because they were trying to protect the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]]. It is impressive how the press gives voice to such a brat." On the same day, Thunberg changed her Twitter description to "''pirralha''", the Portuguese word for "brat" used by Bolsonaro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://g1.globo.com/natureza/noticia/2019/12/10/ativista-greta-thunberg-muda-descricao-no-twitter-para-pirralha-apos-declaracao-de-bolsonaro.ghtml|title=Ativista Greta Thunberg muda descrição no Twitter para 'pirralha' após declaração de Bolsonaro|date=10 December 2019|work=[[G1 (website)|G1]]|access-date=10 December 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191210155236/https://g1.globo.com/natureza/noticia/2019/12/10/ativista-greta-thunberg-muda-descricao-no-twitter-para-pirralha-apos-declaracao-de-bolsonaro.ghtml|archive-date=10 December 2019|language=Portuguese|trans-title=Activist Greta Thunberg changes her Twitter's description to "brat" after Bolsonaro's declaration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2019, Donald Trump shared a video of Thunberg angrily addressing world leaders, along with her quote that "people are dying, entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a [[Holocene extinction|mass extinction]]". Trump wrote about Thunberg, tweeting: "She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!" Thunberg reacted by changing her Twitter bio to match his description, and stating that she could not "understand why grown-ups would choose to mock children and teenagers for just communicating and acting on the science when they could do something good instead."&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources:

=== "The Greta effect" ===

Britain's secretary for the environment, [[Michael Gove]], said: "When I listened to you, I felt great admiration, but also responsibility and guilt. I am of your parents' generation, and I recognise that we haven't done nearly enough to address climate change and the broader environmental crisis that we helped to create." Labour politician [[Ed Miliband]], who was responsible for introducing the [[Climate Change Act 2008]], said: "You have woken us up. We thank you. All the young people who have gone on strike have held up a mirror to our society … you have taught us all a really important lesson. You have stood out from the crowd."&lt;ref name="NEWS-Guardian(2019-04-23)"/&gt;

In February 2019, Thunberg shared a stage with the then [[President of the European Commission]], [[Jean-Claude Juncker]], where he outlined "In the next financial period from 2021 to 2027, every fourth euro spent within the EU budget will go towards action to mitigate climate change".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-teen-activist-idUSKCN1QA1RF|title=Swedish student leader wins EU pledge to spend billions on climate|last=Roth|first=Clare|date=21 February 2019|accessdate=22 July 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190625222613/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-teen-activist-idUSKCN1QA1RF|archive-date=25 June 2019|agency=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate issues also played a significant role in [[2019 European Parliament election|European Parliament election]] in May 2019&lt;ref name="Huggler"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/05/19/europes-greens-sense-moment-climate-takes-centre-stage-elections/|title=The Greta effect?
