'''Naomi Klein''' (b. May 8, 1970, [[Montreal, Quebec]]) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[journalist]], [[author]] and [[Activism|activist]] well known for her political analyses and criticism of corporate [[globalization]].

==Family==
Klein was brought up in a [[Jewish]] family with a history of [[left-wing]] [[activism]]. Her paternal grandparents were [[Marxist]]s who began to turn against the [[Soviet Union]] after the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] and had abandoned [[Communism]] entirely by 1956.&lt;ref name="nyer"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/12/08/081208fa_fact_macfarquhar?currentPage=all|title= Outside Agitator: Naomi Klein and the New Left|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= Larissa MacFarquhar|date= December 8, 2008|work= |publisher= [[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her grandfather, an artist, was fired from [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] for [[labour movement|labour]] organizing&lt;ref name="nyer" /&gt;, see [[Disney animators' strike]].  Her father Michael, a physician, was a [[Vietnam War]] [[draft dodger|resister]] (her parents moved from the US to Canada to avoid the draft&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://departmentofculture.ca/video-naomi-klein-at-last-nights-town-hall/|title= Video: Naomi Klein at last night’s town hall|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= |date= September 4, 2008 |work= |publisher= DepartmentOfCulture.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and a member of [[Physicians for Social Responsibility]].&lt;ref name="nyer" /&gt; Her mother, [[film-maker]] [[Bonnie Sherr Klein]], directed and scripted the [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography]] documentary film, ''[[Not a Love Story]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite visual|director=Bonnie Klein |producer=National Film Board of Canada |title=Not a Love Story: A Motion Picture About Pornography}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC30folder/NotLoveStory.html |title=Not a Love Story: The film and the debate |first=Lisa |last=DiCaprio |issue=30 |month=March |year=1985 |pages=39–42 |journal=Jump Cut |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her brother Seth is director of the British Columbia office of the [[Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives]]. 

Klein's husband, [[Avi Lewis]], comes from a similar background. He is a TV presenter and has collaborated on documentaries with her. Her in-laws are the writer and activist [[Michele Landsberg]] and politician and diplomat [[Stephen Lewis]], son of [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]], the founder of the New Democratic Party.

==Early life==
Klein spent her teenage years as a [[shopping mall|mall]] rat, obsessed by designer logos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/views/092300-103.htm originally printed in the ''Guardian'' 23 September 2000 "Hand-To-Brand-Combat: A Profile Of Naomi Klein"]&lt;/ref&gt; As a child and teenager, she found it "very oppressive to have a very public feminist mother" and she rejected politics, instead embracing "full-on [[consumerism]]". She credits two crises with changing her outlook. First of all, when she was 17 and preparing for the [[University of Toronto]], her mother had a stroke and became severely disabled.&lt;ref name= "abilities"&gt;

{{cite web |url= http://www.enablelink.org/include/article.php?pid=&amp;cid=&amp;subid=&amp;aid=673|title= We are Who You are:Feminism and Disability|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= Bonnie Sherr Klein|date= Spring 1993|work= Abilities|publisher= Enablelink.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naomi, along with her father and brother, took care of Bonnie through the period in hospital and at home, making educational sacrifices to do so.&lt;ref name= "abilities"/&gt; That year off stopped her "from being such a brat" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/views/092300-103.htm originally printed in the ''Guardian'' 23 September 2000 "Hand-To-Brand-Combat: A Profile Of Naomi Klein"]&lt;/ref&gt;

She made it the next year to UofT, when the second event unfolded. The 1989 [[École Polytechnique massacre]] of female engineering students proved her wake-up call to [[feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigthink.com/policy-politics/6340|title=The Montreal Massacre|publisher=Bigthink.com |accessdate=2008-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/views/092300-103.htm originally printed in the ''Guardian'' 23 September 2000 "Hand-To-Brand-Combat: A Profile Of Naomi Klein"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein's writing career started early with contributions to ''[[The Varsity (newspaper)|The Varsity]]'', a [[University of Toronto]] student newspaper, where she served as editor-in-chief.  She dropped out of the University of Toronto to become an intern at the ''[[Toronto Globe and Mail]]'', followed by an editorship at ''[[This Magazine]]''.

==Career in journalism==
In 2000, Klein published the book ''[[No Logo]]'', which for many became a [[manifesto]] of the [[anti-globalization|anti-corporate globalization movement]]. In it, she attacks [[brand name|brand]]-oriented [[consumer culture]] by describing the operations of large [[corporation]]s. She also accuses several such corporations of unethically exploiting workers in the world's poorest countries in pursuit of greater profits. In this book, Klein criticized [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] so severely that Nike published a point-by-point response to perceived inaccuracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010618162615/http://nikebiz.com/labor/nologo_let.shtml  |archivedate=2001-06-18 |url=http://nikebiz.com/labor/nologo_let.shtml |title=Nike's response to ''No Logo'' |date=2000-03-08 |publisher=[[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''No Logo'' became an international bestseller, selling over one million copies in over 28 languages.&lt;ref name="''The Nation'' bio"&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/directory/bios/naomi_klein The Nation | Unconventional Wisdom Since 1865&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 Klein published ''Fences and Windows'', a collection of her articles and speeches written on behalf of the anti-globalization movement (all proceeds from the book go to benefit activist organizations through The Fences and Windows Fund). Klein also contributes to ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', ''[[In These Times]]'', ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', ''[[This Magazine]]'', and ''[[The Guardian]]''.

Klein has written on various current issues, such as the [[Iraq War]]. In a September 2004 article for ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harpers.org/BaghdadYearZero.html |title=Baghdad year zero: Pillaging Iraq in pursuit of a neocon utopia |author= Naomi Klein|year= 2004 |month= September |work= [[Harper's Magazine]] |publisher=The Harper's Magazine Foundation |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; she argues that, contrary to popular belief, the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] did have a clear plan for post-invasion Iraq, which was to build a completely unconstrained [[free market economics|free market economy]]. She describes plans to allow foreigners to extract wealth from Iraq, and the methods used to achieve those goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=04/10/13/144220 Interview] by [[Amy Goodman]] about Klein's article, "James Baker's Double Life", October 13, 2004 (video, audio &amp; print transcript)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/persuaders/interviews/klein.html PBS Frontline: The Persuaders: interview] via KQED, November 9, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 film ''[[War, Inc.]]'' was partially inspired by her article, ''Baghdad Year Zero''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,2159038,00.html|title= I'm basically a brand (article about John Cusack's career)|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= Ryan Gilbey|date= August 31, 2007|work= |publisher= [[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Klein and her husband, [[Avi Lewis]], released a [[documentary film]] called ''[[The Take (2004 film)|The Take]]'' about factory workers in  [[Argentina]] who [[recovered factory|took over a closed plant]] and resumed production, operating as a [[collective]]. The first African screening was in the Kennedy Road shack settlement in the South African city of [[Durban]], where the [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] movement began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nplusonemag.com/klein.html|title= Seattle to Baghdad|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= Kim Phillips-Fein|date= May 10, 2005|work= |publisher= [[n+1]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein ranked 11th in an internet poll &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Global public intellectuals poll | url= http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=7078 |work= Prospect Magazine |publisher= Prospect Publishing Limited |year= 2005 |month= November |first= David |last= Herman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.alternet.org/story/21099/|title= What Are We Fighting For?|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= Lakshmi Chaudhry|date= January 27, 2005|work= |publisher= AlterNet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

She was the highest ranked woman on the list.

===''The Shock Doctrine''===
{{main|The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism}}
Klein's third book, ''The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism'', was published on September 4, 2007, becoming an international and [[New York Times bestseller]]&lt;ref name="''The Nation'' bio"/&gt; translated into 20 languages.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url= http://www.randomhouse.ca/author/results.pperl?authorid=15909|title= Author Spotlight: Naomi Klein|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= |date= |work= |publisher= RandomHouse.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book argues that the free market policies of Nobel Laureate [[Milton Friedman]] and the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School of Economics]] have risen to prominence in countries such as [[Chile under Pinochet]], [[Economy of Russia|Russia under Yeltsin]] and the United States. The book also argues that policy initiatives such as the privatization of Iraq's economy under the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] were pushed through while the citizens of these countries were in [[shock]] from disasters or upheavals. It is also claimed that these shocks are in some cases, such as the [[Falklands war]], created with the intention of being able to push through these unpopular reforms in the wake of the crisis.

''The Shock Doctrine'' was also adapted into a [[short film]] of the same name, released onto [[YouTube]]. The film was directed by Jonás Cuarón, produced and co-written by his father [[Alfonso Cuarón]]. The video has been viewed over one million times.&lt;ref name="''The Nation'' bio"/&gt;

==Other activities==
Klein once lectured as a Miliband Fellow at the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/miliband/visitingTeachingFellows.htm |title=Visiting teaching fellows |publisher=London School of Economics and Political Science |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein was the keynote speaker at the [[Alliance of Concerned Jewish Canadians]] (ACJC)'s first National conference.

In the Guardian newspaper, 10th January 2009, in light of the Israeli bombing of Gaza, Klein made the case for a boycott of Israel to bring about the "end of the occupation", in line with the mass boycott movement against South African apartheid.

==Criticism==

Klein has been criticized by ''[[The Economist]]'', which claims Klein ignores the good capitalism does in the world and holds naive or nebulous ideas for alternatives.&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/people/displaystory.cfm?story_id=1429429 Why Naomi Klein needs to grow up] - [[The Economist]], November 7, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Klein has complained of a tendency to 'ignore the reporting, attack the author'.&lt;ref name= "NaomiKlein.org"/&gt; [[Johan Norberg]] has criticized what he described as flaws in ''The Shock Doctrine''.  He pointed out instances in which he believes Klein has distorted history and he criticized the book for what he said was a misleading presentation of Milton Friedman's views and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=9384|title= The Klein Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Polemics|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= Johan Norberg|date= May 14, 2008|work= |publisher= [[The CATO Institute]]}}


[ ""] by &lt;/ref&gt;  Reviewing the book, [[Jonathan Chait]] (senior editor of the ''The New Republic'') criticized Klein for employing "an extremely crude sort of Marxist economicism," ignoring facts that contradicted her thesis, and "pay[ing] shockingly (but, given her premises, unsurprisingly) little attention to right-wing ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tnr.com/story_print.html?id=69067f1c-d089-474b-a8a0-945d1deb420b|title= Dead Left|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= Jonathan Chait|date= July 30, 2008|work= |publisher= The New Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein argued that Norberg's and Chait's criticism have been largely fraudulent, arguing that 'most of the attacks on ''The Shock Doctrine'' involve manufacturing claims, falsely attributing them to me, then handily tearing them down' and complaining that such criticisms have been overly personal. She wrote: 'Again and again, readers of ''The New Republic'' are left with the distinct impression that ''The Shock Doctrine'' is a work of opinion journalism, rather than a thesis based on research and reporting.'&lt;ref name= "NaomiKlein.org"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.naomiklein.org/articles/2008/09/response-attacks|title= One Year After the Publication of The Shock Doctrine, A Response to the Attacks|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= Naomi Klein|date= September 2nd, 2008|work= |publisher= NaomiKlein.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Norberg has subsequently responded to Klein's defense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=9626 "Three Days After Klein's Response, Another Attack"] by Johan Norberg&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein has been criticized for her portrayal of [[Peron]] in her documentary film ''[[The_Take_(2004_film)|The Take]]'', which makes him appear to be a social democrat.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url= http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/7824|title= The Take|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= Daniel Morduchowicz  |date= September 20, 2004 |work= |publisher=Z Space}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein has also been criticised from the left. Her August 2004 Nation column 'Bring Najaf to New York' was cited by several prominent liberal opinion makers as an example of left minded people making excuses for far right movements. Klein argued that [[Muqtada Al Sadr]]'s [[Mahdi Army]] "represents the overwhelmingly mainstream sentiment in Iraq."&lt;ref name= "The Nation"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thenation.com/doc/20040913/klein|title= Bring Najaf to New York|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= Naomi Klein|date= August 26, 2004|work= |publisher= [[The Nation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to say "Yes, if elected Sadr would try to turn Iraq into a theocracy like Iran, but for now his demands are for direct elections and an end to foreign occupation".&lt;ref name= "The Nation"/&gt;

[[Christopher Hitchens]], a former Nation columnist, responded, calling her position on the Iraq War "reactionary" and arguing that Klein, along with [[Tariq Ali]] and [[Michael Moore]] were "fellow travelers with [[fascism]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.slate.com/id/2106324/|title= Murder by Any Other Name: The rest of the world may be tiring of jihad, but The Nation isn't|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= Christopher Hitchens|date= September 7, 2004|work= |publisher= [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as Ali had called for 'solidarity' with the insurgency and Moore had compared Iraqi insurgents to the [[Minutemen]]). [[Marc Cooper]], also a former Nation columnist, attacked the assertion that Al Sadr represented mainstream Iraqi sentiment and that American forces had brought the fight to the holy city of Najaf.&lt;ref name = "MarcCooper"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://marccooper.typepad.com/marccooper/2004/08/najaf_to_new_yo.html|title= Najaf to New York? Better: New York to Najaf.|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= Marc Cooper|date= August 27, 2004|work= |publisher= Self published blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote "Klein should know better. All enemies of the U.S. occupation she opposes are not her friends. Or ours. Or those of the Iraqi people. I don’t think that Mullah Al Sadr, in any case, is much desirous of support issuing from secular Jewish feminist-socialists."&lt;ref name = "MarcCooper"/&gt; Norman Geras wrote on his blog "Klein's willing to cut him [Al Sadr] some slack. He's only a theocrat, after all, who wants to turn Iraq into a [[theocracy]] like [[Iran]]; he's not of the Republican Party".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://normblog.typepad.com/normblog/2004/08/the_state_of_na.html|title= The state of Naomi Klein|accessdate=2009-02-17 |author= Norman Geras|date= August 27, 2004|work= |publisher= Self published blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;
