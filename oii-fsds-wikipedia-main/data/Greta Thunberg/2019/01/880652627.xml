On 20 August 2018, Thunberg, then in ninth grade, decided to not attend school until the [[Swedish general election, 2018|2018 Sweden general election]] on 9 September after [[2018 European heat wave|heat waves]] and [[2018 Sweden wildfires|wildfires]] in Sweden.&lt;ref name=Guardian1/&gt; Her demands were that the Swedish government reduce carbon emissions as per the [[Paris Agreement]], and she protested via sitting outside the [[Riksdag]] every day during school hours with the sign ''Skolstrejk för klimatet'' (school strike for the climate).&lt;ref name=Newyorker1/&gt;

After the general elections, she continued to strike only on Fridays, which gained worldwide attention. She inspired school students across the globe to take part in student strikes.&lt;ref name=Guardian2/&gt; As of December 2018, more than 20,000 students held strikes in at least 270 cities&lt;ref name=Guardian2/&gt; in countries including Australia, Austria,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/168763685@N07/albums|title=FridaysforFuture Vienna|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=29 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belgium, Canada,&lt;ref name=Larsen&gt;{{Cite news |author=Karin Larsen |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/metro-vancouver-students-cut-class-to-demand-action-on-climate-change-1.4936647 |title=Metro Vancouver students cut class to demand action on climate change |date=7 December 2018 |work=CBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Netherlands, Germany, Finland, Denmark, Japan, Switzerland,&lt;ref name=ILJ&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/global-warming_more-than-1-000-swiss-pupils-strike-over-climate/44636034 |title=More than 1,000 Swiss pupils strike over climate |date=21 December 2018 |work=swissinfo.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.rts.ch/info/regions/autres-cantons/10091787-la-greve-du-climat-rassemble-des-centaines-d-etudiants-alemaniques.html |title=La "grève du climat" rassemble des centaines d'étudiants alémaniques |date=22 December 2018 |work=[[RTS Info]] |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United Kingdom and the United States.&lt;ref name=Guardian2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/klimat/klimatmanifestation-over-hela-landet-odesfraga/ |title=Klimatmanifestation över hela landet: "Ödesfråga" |date=30 November 2018 |work=[[Expressen]] |language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, thousands of school students were inspired by Thunberg to strike on Fridays, ignoring Prime Minister [[Scott Morrison]]'s comments of "more learning in schools and less activism".&lt;ref name=Wilkinson&gt;{{Cite news |author=Bard Wilkinson |url=https://edition-m.cnn.com/2018/11/30/australia/australia-school-climate-strike-scli-intl/index.html?r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dclimate%2Bstrike%2BAustralia%26client%3Ducweb-b%26channel%3Dsb |title=Australian school children defy prime minister with climate strike |date=30 November 2018 |work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other activism ==
Greta Thunberg participated in the Rise for Climate demonstration outside the [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]] and the Declaration of Rebellion organized by [[Extinction Rebellion]] in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/10/31/our-darkest-hour-declaration-rebellion-new-group-vows-mass-civil-disobedience-save |title=This Is Our Darkest Hour: With Declaration of Rebellion, New Group Vows Mass Civil Disobedience to Save Planet |date=31 October 2018 |work=Common Dreams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 November 2018, she spoke at [[TED (conference)#TEDx|TEDxStockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TEDxStockholm Theme: Wonderland |url=https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/31825 |publisher=TED |accessdate=20 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She speaks about autism as a way to explain why she cannot understand the inaction of governments and of citizens on climatic threat. Towards the conclusion of her talk, Thunberg said, "We've had thirty years of pep-talking and selling positive ideas. And I'm sorry, but it doesn't work. Because if it would have, the emissions would have gone down by now—they haven't."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jon |first1=Queally |title=Depressed and Then Diagnosed With Autism, Greta Thunberg Explains Why Hope Cannot Save Planet But Bold Climate Action Still Can |url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/12/19/depressed-and-then-diagnosed-autism-greta-thunberg-explains-why-hope-cannot-save |publisher=Common Dreams |accessdate=20 December 2018 |date=19 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote | text = "Some people say that the climate crisis is something that we all have created, but that is not true, because if everyone is guilty then no one is to blame. And someone is to blame. Some people, some companies, some decision-makers in particular, have known exactly what priceless values they have been sacrificing to continue making unimaginable amounts of money. And I think many of you here today belong to that group of people."}}

== Prizes and awards ==
Greta Thunberg was one of the winners of [[Svenska Dagbladet]]'s debate article writing competition on the climate for young people in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.svd.se/vi-vet--och-vi-kan-gora-nagot-nu|title="Vi vet – och vi kan göra något nu" {{!}} SvD|website=SvD.se|language=sv|access-date=22 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunberg was nominated for the electricity company Telge Energi's prize for children and young people who promote sustainable development, ''Children's Climate Prize,'' but declined because the finalists would have to fly to Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etc.se/klimat/darfor-nobbar-greta-thunberg-klimatpriset|title=Därför nobbar Greta Thunberg klimatpriset|last=Gelin|first=Gustav|date=1 November 2018|website=ETC|language=sv|access-date=22 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2018, she was awarded the Fryshuset scholarship of the Young Role Model of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aktuellhallbarhet.se/greta-thunberg-blir-arets-unga-forebild/|title=Greta Thunberg blir Årets unga förebild|date=22 November 2018|website=Aktuell Hållbarhet|language=sv-SE|access-date=22 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2018, ''Time'' magazine named Thunberg one of the world's 25 most influential teenagers of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/5463721/most-influential-teens-2018/|title=TIME's 25 Most Influential Teens of 2018|website=Time|language=en|access-date=22 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
