Klein first became known internationally for her [[alter-globalization]] book ''[[No Logo]]'' (1999). ''[[The Take (2004 film)|The Take]]'' (2004), a documentary film about [[Workers' self-management#The f.C3.A1bricas recuperadas movement|Argentina's occupied factories]], written by her and directed by her husband [[Avi Lewis]], further increased her profile, while ''[[The Shock Doctrine]]'' (2007), a critical analysis of the history of [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economics, solidified her standing as a prominent activist on the international stage. ''The Shock Doctrine'' was adapted into a six-minute companion film by [[Alfonso Cuarón|Alfonso]] and [[Jonás Cuarón]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shock Doctrine: A Film by Alfonso Cuaron and Naomi Klein|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/video/2007/sep/07/naomiklein|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=September 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a feature-length documentary by [[Michael Winterbottom]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Sam; [https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/aug/28/naomi-klein-winterbottom-shock-doctrine "Naomi Klein disowns Winterbottom adaptation of Shock Doctrine"] ''Guardian.co.uk'', August 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Klein's ''[[This Changes Everything (book)|This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate]]'' (2014) was a [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'']] non-fiction bestseller and the winner of the [[Hilary Weston Writers' Trust Prize for Nonfiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Prize Winner|url=http://www.writerstrust.com/awards/hilary-weston-writers-trust-prize.aspx|location=Hilary Weston Writers' Trust Prize for Nonfiction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Naomi Klein was born in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], and brought up in a Jewish family with a history of peace activism. Her parents were self-described hippies&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Naomi. ''No Logo'' (2000: Vintage Canada), pp. 143-4.&lt;/ref&gt; who emigrated from the United States in 1967 as [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|war resisters to the Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="doc_townhall"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hA736oK9FPg/ |title=Video: Naomi Klein addresses the Department of Culture Town Hall |access-date=July 26, 2012 |date=September 4, 2008 |publisher=Department Of Culture |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428050703/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hA736oK9FPg%2F |archive-date=April 28, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, documentary film-maker [[Bonnie Sherr Klein]], is best known for her [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography]] film ''[[Not a Love Story: A Film About Pornography|Not a Love Story]]''.&lt;ref name="bonnie_sherr_klein_bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/women/002026-704-e.html |title=Biography of Bonnie Sherr Klein (*1941): Filmmaker, Author, Disability Rights Activist |publisher=Library and Archives Canada |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401062935/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/women/002026-704-e.html |archive-date=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, Michael Klein, is a physician and a member of [[Physicians for Social Responsibility]]. Her brother, Seth Klein, is an author and the former director of the [[British Columbia]] office of the [[Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives]].

Before World War II, her paternal grandparents were communists, but they began to turn against the Soviet Union after the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] in 1939. In 1942, her grandfather, an animator at [[Disney]], was fired after [[Disney animators' strike|the 1941 strike]],&lt;ref name="tom_sito_disney"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animationguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/PB200606.pdf|title=The Disney Strike of 1941: How It Changed Animation &amp; Comics|access-date=March 25, 2009|first=Tom|last=Sito|date=July 19, 2005|publisher=Animation World Magazine|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006083927/http://animationguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/PB200606.pdf|archive-date=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had to switch to working in a shipyard instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/11/naomi-klein-donald-trump-no-is-not-enough-interview|title=Naomi Klein: 'Trump is an idiot, but don't underestimate how good he is at that'|first=Tim|last=Adams|date=June 11, 2017|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1956 they had abandoned communism. Klein's father grew up surrounded by ideas of social justice and racial equality, but found it "difficult and frightening to be the child of Communists", a so-called [[red diaper baby]].&lt;ref name="nyer" /&gt;

Klein's husband, [[Avi Lewis]], was born into a political and journalistic family. His grandfather, [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]], was an architect and leader of the federal [[New Democratic Party]], while his father, [[Stephen Lewis]], was a leader of the [[Ontario New Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Gatehouse|first=Jonathon|date=2016-04-12|title=Avi Lewis on the 'ideological battle' over the Leap Manifesto|url=https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/avi-lewis-on-the-ideological-battle-over-the-leap-manifesto/|access-date=2020-12-03|website=Maclean's}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avi Lewis works as a TV journalist and documentary filmmaker. The couple's only child, son Toma, was born on June 13, 2012.&lt;ref name="Naomi_Klein_Facebook_Page"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.facebook.com/pages/Naomi-Klein/12400234918|title=Naomi Klein|publisher=Facebook|date=March 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Klein spent much of her teenage years in shopping malls, obsessed with designer labels.&lt;ref name="Hand-to-Brand"/&gt; As a child and teenager, she found it "very oppressive to have a very public feminist mother" and she rejected politics, instead embracing "full-on consumerism".&lt;ref name="Hand-to-Brand"/&gt;

She has attributed her change in worldview to two catalysts. One was when she was 17 and preparing for the [[University of Toronto]], her mother had a stroke and became severely disabled.&lt;ref name="abilities"/&gt; Naomi, her father, and her brother took care of Bonnie through the period in hospital and at home, making educational sacrifices to do so.&lt;ref name="abilities"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enablelink.org/include/article.php?pid=&amp;cid=&amp;subid=&amp;aid=673 |title=We are Who You are:Feminism and Disability |access-date=February 17, 2009 |first=Bonnie Sherr |last=Klein |date=Spring 1993 |work=Abilities |publisher=Enablelink.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011204526/http://www.enablelink.org/include/article.php?pid=&amp;cid=&amp;subid=&amp;aid=673 |archive-date=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That year off prevented her "from being such a brat".&lt;ref name="Hand-to-Brand"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.commondreams.org/views/092300-103.htm|title= Hand-To-Brand-Combat: A Profile Of Naomi Klein|access-date= February 17, 2009|first= Katharine|last= Viner|date= September 23, 2000|newspaper= The Guardian|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090122050446/http://www.commondreams.org/views/092300-103.htm|archive-date= January 22, 2009|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, after beginning her studies at the [[University of Toronto]], the second catalyst occurred: the 1989 [[École Polytechnique massacre]] of female engineering students, which proved to be a wake-up call to feminism.&lt;ref name="montreal-massacre"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eET3COi8DPY|title= Naomi Klein: The Montreal Massacre |publisher= Youtube.com|access-date= May 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein's writing career began with contributions to ''[[The Varsity (newspaper)|The Varsity]]'', a student newspaper, where she served as editor-in-chief.  After her third year at the University of Toronto, she dropped out of university to take a job at ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', followed by an editorship at ''[[This Magazine]]''. In 1995, she returned to the University of Toronto with the intention of finishing her degree&lt;ref name="nyer"&gt;{{cite magazine|url= http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/12/08/081208fa_fact_macfarquhar?currentPage=all|title= Outside Agitator: Naomi Klein and the New Left|first= Larissa |last=MacFarquhar|date= December 8, 2008|magazine= [[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but left academia for a journalism internship before acquiring the final credits required to complete her degree.&lt;ref&gt;Q&amp;A Interview with Brian Lamb, on CSPAN, dated November 29, 2009, [http://www.c-span.org/video/?290173-1/qa-naomi-klein Klein Q&amp;A interview and transcript]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

===''No Logo''===

{{Main|No Logo}}
In 1999 Klein published the book ''[[No Logo]]'', which for many became a manifesto of the anti-globalization movement. In it, she attacks brand-oriented consumer culture and the operations of large corporations. She also accuses several such corporations of unethically exploiting workers in the world's poorest countries in pursuit of greater profits. In this book, Klein criticized [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] so severely that Nike published a point-by-point response.&lt;ref name="no-logo-nike"&gt;{{cite web|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20000416175422/http://nikebiz.com/labor/nologo_let.shtml  |archive-date= April 16, 2000 |url= http://nikebiz.com/labor/nologo_let.shtml|title= Nike's response to ''No Logo''|date= March 8, 2000|publisher= [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''No Logo'' became an international bestseller, selling over one million copies in over 28 languages.&lt;ref name="Nation-bio"/&gt;

===''Fences and Windows''===

{{Main|Fences and Windows}}
Klein's ''[[Fences and Windows]]'' (2002) is a collection of her articles and speeches written on behalf of the anti-globalization movement (all proceeds from the book go to benefit activist organizations through The Fences and Windows Fund).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ereserve.library.sydney.edu.au.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au/fisher/KleinFences2002.pdf|title=Login to eResources, The University of Sydney Library|website=Ereserve.library.sydney.edu.au.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au|access-date=September 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Take''===
{{Main|The Take (2004 film)}}
''[[The Take (2004 film)|The Take]]'' (2004), a documentary film collaboration by Klein and Lewis, concerns factory workers in [[Argentina]] who took over a closed plant and resumed production, operating as a collective. The first African screening was in the Kennedy Road shack settlement in the South African city of [[Durban]], where the [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] movement began.&lt;ref name="Phillips-Fein"&gt;{{cite magazine|url= http://www.nplusonemag.com/klein.html|title= Seattle to Baghdad|access-date= February 17, 2009|first= Kim|last= Phillips-Fein|date= May 10, 2005|magazine= [[n+1]]|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080110090803/http://www.nplusonemag.com/klein.html|archive-date= January 10, 2008|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in ''[[Z Communications]]'' criticized ''The Take'' for its portrayal of the Argentine general and politician [[Juan Domingo Perón]] arguing that he was falsely portrayed as a social democrat.&lt;ref name="the_take"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://zcomm.org/znetarticle/the-take-by-daniel-morduchowicz-1|title= The Take|access-date=February 17, 2009|first= Daniel |last=Morduchowicz|date= September 20, 2004|publisher=Z Space}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Shock Doctrine''===

{{Main|The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism}}
Klein's third book, ''The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism'', was published on September 4, 2007. The book argues that the free market policies of Nobel Laureate [[Milton Friedman]] and the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School of Economics]] have risen to prominence in countries such as [[Military government of Chile (1973–1990)|Chile, under Pinochet]], Poland, [[Economy of Russia|Russia, under Yeltsin]]. The book also argues that policy initiatives (for instance, the privatization of Iraq's economy under the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]]) were rushed through while the citizens of these countries were in shock from disasters, upheavals, or invasion. The book became an international and [[The New York Times bestseller|''New York Times'' bestseller]]&lt;ref name="Nation-bio"/&gt; and was translated into 28 languages.&lt;ref name="RandomHouse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.ca/author/results.pperl?authorid=15909 |title=Author Spotlight: Naomi Klein |access-date=February 17, 2009 |publisher=RandomHouse.ca |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020111515/http://www.randomhouse.ca/author/results.pperl?authorid=15909 |archive-date=October 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Naomi Klein Warsaw Nov. 19 2008 Fot Mariusz Kubik 03.jpg|thumbnail|left|Klein in 2008 with the Polish edition of ''Shock Doctrine'']]
Central to the book's thesis is the contention that those who wish to implement unpopular [[free market]] policies now routinely do so by taking advantage of certain features of the aftermath of major disasters, be they economic, political, military or natural. The suggestion is that when a society experiences a major 'shock' there is a widespread desire for a rapid and decisive response to correct the situation; this desire for bold and immediate action provides an opportunity for unscrupulous actors to implement policies which go far beyond a legitimate response to disaster. The book suggests that when the rush to act means the specifics of a response will go unscrutinized, that is the moment when unpopular and unrelated policies will intentionally be rushed into effect. The book appears to claim that these shocks are in some cases intentionally encouraged or even manufactured.

Klein identifies the "shock doctrine", elaborating on [[Joseph Schumpeter]], as the latest in capitalism's phases of "creative destruction".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/cockburn09222007.html|title=On Naomi Klein's "The Shock Doctrine"|publisher=[[CounterPunch]]|first=Alexander|last=Cockburn|date=September 22–23, 2007|author-link=Alexander Cockburn|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330150629/http://www.counterpunch.org/cockburn09222007.html|archive-date=March 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Shock Doctrine'' was adapted into a short film of the same name, released onto [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iW1SHPgUAQ|title=YouTube|website=Youtube.com|access-date=March 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original is no longer available on the site, however, a duplicate was published in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=sirine|first1=1|title=The Shock Doctrine Naomi Klein and Alfonso Cuaron|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSF0e6oO_tw|website=YouTube|publisher=YouTube|access-date=April 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was directed by [[Jonás Cuarón]], produced and co-written by his father [[Alfonso Cuarón]]. The original video was viewed over one million times.&lt;ref name="Nation-bio"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.thenation.com/authors/naomi-klein/ |title=Naomi Klein |magazine=The Nation |access-date=August 12, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of ''The Shock Doctrine'' increased Klein's prominence, with ''[[The New Yorker]]'' judging her "the most visible and influential figure on the American left—what [[Howard Zinn]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] were thirty years ago." On February 24, 2009, the book was awarded the inaugural [[Warwick Prize for Writing]] from the [[University of Warwick]] in England. The prize carried a cash award of £50,000.

=== Iraq War criticism ===
Klein has written about the [[Iraq War]]. In "Baghdad Year Zero" (''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', September 2004),&lt;ref name="Harpers"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.harpers.org/BaghdadYearZero.html|title= Baghdad year zero: Pillaging Iraq in pursuit of a neocon utopia|first= Naomi |last=Klein|date=September 2004|work= [[Harper's Magazine]]|publisher= The Harper's Magazine Foundation|access-date= September 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klein argues that, contrary to popular belief, the [[George W. Bush administration]] ''did'' have a clear plan for post-invasion Iraq: to build a completely unconstrained [[free market]] economy. She describes plans to allow foreigners to extract wealth from Iraq and the methods used to achieve those goals.&lt;ref name="Democracy-Now"&gt;{{cite interview|last= Klein|first= Naomi|title= Broadcast Exclusive: James Baker's Double Life in Iraq: The Carlyle Group Stands to Make Killing on Iraqi Debt|interviewer= [[Amy Goodman]]|work= [[Democracy Now!]]|publisher= [[Pacifica Radio]]|date= October 13, 2004|access-date= February 17, 2009|url= http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=04/10/13/144220|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20041013192326/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=04%2F10%2F13%2F144220|url-status= dead|archive-date= October 13, 2004|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite interview|last= Klein|first= Naomi|title= The Persuaders: Interview Naomi Klein|publisher = [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|date= January 22, 2004|work= [[PBS Frontline]] |access-date= February 17, 2009|url= https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/persuaders/interviews/klein.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her "Baghdad Year Zero" was one of the inspirations for the 2008 film ''[[War, Inc.]]''&lt;ref name="film.guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,2159038,00.html|title= I'm basically a brand (article about John Cusack's career)|access-date= February 17, 2009|first= Ryan |last=Gilbey|date= August 31, 2007|newspaper= The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein's "Bring Najaf to New York" (''The Nation'', August 2004) argued that [[Muqtada Al Sadr]]'s [[Mahdi Army]] "represents the overwhelmingly mainstream sentiment in Iraq" and that, if he were elected, "Sadr would try to turn Iraq into a [[theocracy]] like Iran," although his immediate demands were for "direct elections and an end to foreign occupation".&lt;ref name="Najif-Nation"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/bring-najaf-new-york/ |title=Bring Najaf to New York |access-date=August 12, 2017 |first=Naomi |last=Klein |date=August 26, 2004 |work=[[The Nation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marc Cooper]], a former ''Nation'' columnist, attacked the assertion that Al Sadr represented mainstream Iraqi sentiment and that American forces had brought the war to the holy city of [[Najaf]]. "Klein should know better," he wrote. "All enemies of the U.S. occupation she opposes are not her friends. Or ours. Or those of the Iraqi people. I don't think that Mullah Al Sadr, in any case, is much desirous of support issuing from secular Jewish feminist-socialists."&lt;ref name="MarcCooper"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://marccooper.typepad.com/marccooper/2004/08/najaf_to_new_yo.html|title= Najaf to New York?

=== Venezuela ===
Klein signed a 2004 petition entitled "We would vote for [[Hugo Chávez]]".&lt;ref name="AliVoteChavez"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ali|first1=Tariq|title=We Would Vote for Hugo Chavez|url=https://www.counterpunch.org/2004/07/27/we-would-vote-for-hugo-chavez/|access-date=August 4, 2017|publisher=[[CounterPunch]]|date=July 27, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, she described [[Venezuela]] under the Chávez government as a country where "citizens had renewed their faith in the power of democracy to improve their lives,"  and described Venezuela as a place sheltered by Chávez's policies from the economic shocks produced by capitalism.&lt;ref name="KleinShockDoctrine"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Klein|first1=Naomi|title=The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism|date=2010|publisher=Henry Holt|isbn=978-1429919487|pages=566, 549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, according to Klein, Chávez protected his country from financial crisis by building "a zone of relative economic calm and predictability."&lt;ref name="KleinShockDoctrine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KleinShcckResistance"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Klein|first1=Naomi|title=Latin America's Shock Resistance|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/latin-americas-shock-resistance/|access-date=August 4, 2017|magazine=[[The Nation]]|date=November 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to reviewer [[Todd Gitlin]], who described the overall argument of Klein's book ''[[The Shock Doctrine]]'' (2007) as "more right than wrong," Klein is "a romantic," who expected that the Chávez government would produce a bright future in which worker-controlled co-operatives would run the economy.&lt;ref name="GitlinFirst"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gitlin|first1=Todd|title=First we take Chase Manhattan ...|newspaper=Globe and Mail|date=September 8, 2007|id={{ProQuest|383406476}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Shock Doctrine'' was consistent with her prior thinking about [[globalization]], and in that book she describes Chávez' policies as an example of public control of some sectors of the economy as protecting poor people from harm caused by globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Campbell|first1=Leslie|title=Audacious Undertaking: Review of The Shock Doctrine|url=http://reviewcanada.ca/magazine/2007/11/audacious-undertaking/|work=[[Literary Review of Canada]]|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Crisis in Venezuela|collapse]] of the [[economy of Venezuela|Venezuelan economy]] and severe erosion of its democratic institutions under Chávez' successor [[Nicolás Maduro]], Klein and other people who had supported Chávez were criticized by conservative writers such as [[James Kirchick]]&lt;ref name="KirchickVenezuela"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirchick|first1=James|title=Remember all those left-wing pundits who drooled over Venezuela?|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-kirchick-venezuela-pundits-20170802-story.html|access-date=August 3, 2017|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mark Milke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Milke|first1=Mark|title=Venezuela's collapse and the 'useful idiots' of the Canadian left|url=http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/venezuelas-collapse-and-the-useful-idiots-of-the-canadian-left/|access-date=August 4, 2017|magazine=[[Maclean's]]|date=May 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism of Israel ===
In March 2008, Klein was the keynote speaker at the first national conference of the [[Independent Jewish Voices (Canada)|Alliance of Concerned Jewish Canadians]].  In January 2009, during the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]], Klein supported the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] (BDS) campaign against [[Israel]], arguing that "the best strategy to end the increasingly bloody occupation is for Israel to become the target of the kind of global movement that put an end to apartheid in South Africa."&lt;ref name="time-for-boycott"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jan/10/naomi-klein-boycott-israel|title= Enough. It's time for a boycott|access-date= July 13, 2009|first= Naomi |last=Klein|date= January 10, 2009|work= The Guardian | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 2009, on the occasion of the publication of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] translation of her book ''The Shock Doctrine'', Klein visited Israel, the [[West Bank]], and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]], combining the promotion of her book and the BDS campaign. In an interview to the Israeli newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'' she emphasized that it is important to her "not to boycott Israelis but rather to boycott the normalization of Israel and the conflict."&lt;ref name="klein_haaretz"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.haaretz.com/news/naomi-klein-oppose-the-state-not-the-people-1.279194|title= Naomi Klein: Oppose the State, Not the People|access-date=March 22, 2016|first=Yotam |last=Feldman|date= July 1, 2009|work= [[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech in [[Ramallah]] on June 27, she apologized to the [[Palestinians]] for not joining the BDS campaign earlier.&lt;ref name="klein_ramallah"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://thefastertimes.com/Palestine/2009/07/07/naomi-klein-in-ramallah-i-am-ashamed-that-it-took-me-this-long-to-endorse-the-call-to-boycott-israel…it-was-nothing-but-cowardice/|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090713024624/http://thefastertimes.com/Palestine/2009/07/07/naomi-klein-in-ramallah-i-am-ashamed-that-it-took-me-this-long-to-endorse-the-call-to-boycott-israel%E2%80%A6it-was-nothing-but-cowardice/|url-status= dead|archive-date= July 13, 2009|title= Naomi Klein in Ramallah: I am ashamed that it took me this long|access-date= July 13, 2009|first= Naomi|last= Klein|date= July 7, 2009|publisher= The Faster Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her remarks, particularly that "[Some Jews] even think we get one get-away-with-genocide-free card" were characterized by Noam Schimmel, an op-ed columnist in ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', as "violent" and "unethical", and as the "most perverse of aspersions on Jews, an age-old stereotype of Jews as intrinsically evil and malicious."&lt;ref name="schimmel"&gt;{{cite news|title= 'The Jews' get-away-with-genocide-free-card'|newspaper= [[Jerusalem Post]]|first= Noam |last=Schimmel |url= http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/The-Jews-get-away-with-genocide-free-card |date= July 18, 2009 |access-date=August 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein was also a spokesperson for the protest against the [[2009 Toronto International Film Festival#Controversy over Tel Aviv spotlight|spotlight on Tel Aviv]] at the [[2009 Toronto International Film Festival]], a spotlight that Klein said was a very selective and misleading portrait of Israel.&lt;ref name="globe_and_mail"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/we-dont-feel-like-celebrating-with-israel-this-year/article1278582/|title= We don't feel like celebrating with Israel this year.|first= Naomi |last=Klein|newspaper= [[The Globe and Mail]] |date= September 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmentalism ===

{{rquote|right|Indeed the three policy pillars of the neoliberal age—privatization of the public sphere, deregulation of the corporate sector, and the lowering of income and corporate taxes, paid for with cuts to public spending—are each incompatible with many of the actions we must take to bring our emissions to safe levels. And together these pillars form an ideological wall that has blocked a serious response to climate change for decades.| Naomi Klein&lt;ref&gt;''[[This Changes Everything (book)|This Changes Everything]]'', pp. 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since 2009, Klein's attention has turned to environmentalism, with particular focus on [[climate change]], the subject of her book ''[[This Changes Everything (book)|This Changes Everything]]'' (2014).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2011/3/9/my_fear_is_that_climate_change "'My Fear is that Climate Change is the Biggest Crisis of All': Naomi Klein Warns Global Warming Could Be Exploited by Capitalism and Militarism"], ''Democracy Now!'', March 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; According to her website, the book and its accompanying film (released in 2015) will be about "how the [[climate crisis]] can spur economic and political transformation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naomiklein.org/meet-naomi Meet Naomi] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815071747/http://www.naomiklein.org/meet-naomi |date=August 15, 2016 }}, Naomi Klein Official Web Site&lt;/ref&gt; She sits on the board of directors of campaign group [[350.org]]&lt;ref&gt;350.org Our Team: http://www.350.org/en/our-team&lt;/ref&gt; and took part in their "Do the Math" tour in 2013, encouraging a divestment movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.350.org/en/about/blogs/naomi-klein-does-math "Naomi Klein does the math"], 350.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

She has encouraged the [[Occupy movement]] to join forces with the environmental movement, saying the financial crisis and the climate crisis have the same root—unrestrained corporate greed.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJ8CoxnjjZg |title=Naomi Klein: Obama's Delay of Keystone XL Oil Pipeline Decision is Win for Environmentalists |publisher=YouTube |date=November 11, 2011 |access-date=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She gave a speech at [[Occupy Wall Street]] where she described the world as "upside down", where we act as if "there is no end to what is actually finite—fossil fuels and the atmospheric space to absorb their emissions," and as if there are "limits to what is actually bountiful—the financial resources to build the kind of society we need."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/163844/occupy-wall-street-most-important-thing-world-now# |title=Occupy Wall Street: The Most Important Thing in the World Now |newspaper=The Nation |date=October 6, 2011 |access-date=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has been a particularly vocal critic of the [[Athabasca oil sands]] in Alberta, describing it in a [[TED Talk|TED talk]] as a form of "terrestrial skinning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/naomi_klein_addicted_to_risk.html |title=Naomi Klein: Addicted to risk |work=Ted.com |access-date=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 2, 2011, she attended the demonstration against the [[Keystone XL]] pipeline outside the White House and was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2011/09/02/world-naomi-klein-arrested-at-white-house-keystone-pipeline-protest.html |title=Naomi Klein arrested at D.C. pipeline protest |work=Cbc.ca |date=September 2, 2011 |access-date=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klein celebrated Obama's decision to postpone a decision on the [[Keystone pipeline]] until 2013 pending an environmental review as a victory for the environmental movement.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

She attended the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Copenhagen Climate Summit of 2009]]. She put the blame for the failure of Copenhagen on President [[Barack Obama]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/dec/21/copenhagen-failure-obama-climate-change |title=Copenhagen's failure belongs to Obama |work=The Guardian |date=December 21, 2009 |access-date=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and described her own country, Canada, as a "climate criminal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO9G1r2aBEo |title=Naomi Klein Implicates Corporate Climate Lobbyists at COP15 |publisher=YouTube |access-date=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She presented the Angry Mermaid Award (a satirical award designed to recognise the corporations who have best sabotaged the climate negotiations) to [[Monsanto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge864JnnVm0 |title=Naomi Klein gives 'Angry Mermaid Award' in Copenhagen |publisher=YouTube |date=December 15, 2009 |access-date=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the wake of [[Hurricane Sandy]], she warned that the climate crisis constitutes a massive opportunity for disaster capitalists and corporations seeking to profit from crisis. But equally, the climate crisis "can be a historic moment to usher in the next great wave of progressive change," or a so-called "People's Shock."&lt;ref&gt;''The Nation'', "[http://www.thenation.com/article/171048/super-storm-sandy-peoples-shock# Superstorm Sandy - a People's Shock?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, following the election of [[Donald Trump]] as the 45th President of the United States, Klein called for an international campaign to impose economic sanctions on the United States if his administration refuses to abide by the terms of the [[Paris Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/NaomiAKlein/status/796492486122360835 |title=Naomi Klein on Twitter |access-date=November 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
