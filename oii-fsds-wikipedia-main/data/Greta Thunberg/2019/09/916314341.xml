'''Greta Thunberg'''{{efn|{{IPA-sv|²ɡreːta ²tʉːnbærj|lang|Sv-Greta Thunberg.ogg}}}} (born &lt;!-- EDITORS Per our BLP policy, specifically [[WP:DOB]], do not list a specific day unless you can show its WIDELY reported in mainstream RSs or Thunberg herself releases it --&gt;January 2003&lt;ref name="Birth-MonthYear" &gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/315/315787/no-one-is-too-small-to-make-a-difference/9780141991740.html |title=No One Is Too Small to Make a Difference |last=Thunberg |first=Greta |website=Penguin  Random House UK |language=en |access-date=2019-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a Swedish environmental activist who is credited with raising global awareness of the risks posed by [[global warming|climate change]], and with holding politicians to account for their lack of action on the [[climate crisis]].

In August 2018, at 15 years of age, Thunberg took time off school to demonstrate outside the [[Swedish parliament]], holding up a sign calling for [[Climate change mitigation|stronger climate action]].  Soon, other students engaged in similar protests in their own communities. Together they organized a [[school climate strike|school climate strike movement]], under the name ''Fridays for Future''.&lt;!-- EDITORS on the Eng Wiki Fridays for Future is a redirect back to our article "School climate strike" --&gt; After Thunberg addressed the [[2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference]], student strikes took place every week somewhere in the world.

At home, Thunberg persuaded her parents to adopt several [[Individual action on climate change|lifestyle choices]] to reduce their own [[carbon footprint]], including [[Climate impact of aviation|giving up air travel]] and [[Meat#Climate change|not eating meat]].

In May 2019, Thunberg was featured on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, which named her a "next generation leader" and noted that many see her as a role model.&lt;ref name="WEB-PBN(2019-05-16)"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.plantbasednews.org/post/greta-thunberg-cover-time |title=Greta Thunberg On The Cover Of TIME: 'Now I Am Speaking to the Whole World' |last=Gilliver|first=Liam |website=Plant Based News |date=16 May 2019|accessdate=2019-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunberg and the school strike movement were also featured in a 30 minute ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' documentary titled ''Make the World Greta Again''. Some media have described her impact on the world stage as the "Greta Thunberg effect".&lt;ref name="NEWS-Guaridan(2019-04-23)"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/23/greta-thunberg |title=The Greta Thunberg effect: at last, MPs focus on climate change |last=Watts |first=Jonathan   |date=2019-04-23 |work=The Guardian |access-date=2019-08-30 |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Greta Thunberg was born in 2003.&lt;ref name="NoOneIsTooSmall" /&gt; Her mother, [[Malena Ernman]], is a Swedish opera singer, and her father is actor [[Svante Thunberg]].&lt;ref name="Democracy Now"/&gt; Her grandfather is actor and director [[Olof Thunberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://heavy.com/news/2018/12/greta-thunberg/ |title=Greta Thunberg: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know |last=Santiago |first=Ellyn |date=14 December 2018 |website=[[Heavy.com]] |access-date=5 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thunberg says she first heard about climate change in 2011, when she was 8 years old, and could not understand why so little was being done about it.&lt;ref name="YouTube-Thunberg(2018-11-24)"&gt;{{cite AV media |first=Greta |last=Thunberg |date=2018-11-24 |title=School strike for climate – save the world by changing the rules |publisher=TEDxStockholm |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAmmUIEsN9A&amp;t=1m46s |access-date=29 January 2019 |time=1:46 |via=[[YouTube]] |quote=I was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, OCD, and selective mutism.

For about two years, Thunberg challenged her parents to lower the family's [[carbon footprint]] by becoming [[Environmental vegetarianism|vegan]] and [[Environmental impact of aviation|giving up flying]], which in part meant her mother had to give up her international career as an opera singer.&lt;ref name="Democracy Now"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;  Thunberg credits her parents' eventual response and lifestyle changes with giving her hope and belief that she could make a difference.&lt;ref name="Democracy Now" /&gt; The family story is recounted in the 2018 book ''[[Scenes from the Heart]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://livewire.thewire.in/politics/greta-thunberg-film-childhood8491/|title='Scenes From the Heart': Backstory of 16-Year-Old Climate Activist Greta Thunberg|date=6 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 2018, Thunberg began the school climate strikes and public speeches by which she has become an internationally recognized [[climate activist]].  Her father does not like her missing school, but said: "[We] respect that she wants to make a stand. She can either sit at home and be really unhappy, or protest, and be happy".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/sep/01/swedish-15-year-old-cutting-class-to-fight-the-climate-crisis |title=The Swedish 15-year-old who's cutting class to fight the climate crisis |last=Crouch |first=David |date=1 September 2018 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=12 May 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thunberg says her teachers are divided in their views about her missing class to make her point. She says: "As people they think what I am doing is good, but as teachers they say I should stop."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Thunberg published a collection of her climate action speeches, ''[[No One Is Too Small to Make a Difference]]'', in May 2019&lt;ref name="NoOneIsTooSmall"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/315/315787/no-one-is-too-small-to-make-a-difference/9780141991740.html |title=No One Is Too Small to Make a Difference |publisher=Penguin Books UK|accessdate=2019-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the earnings being donated to charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/24/you-ask-the-questions-greta-thunberg-interview-global-climate-strike |title=Send us your questions for climate activist Greta Thunberg |newspaper=The Guardian |date=24 May 2019|accessdate=2019-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In one of her first speeches demanding climate action, Thunberg described the selective mutism aspect of her condition as meaning she only speaks when necessary, and said "now is one of those moments".&lt;ref name="YouTube-Thunberg(2018-11-24)"/&gt; In 2019, Thunberg also contributed a [[voiceover]] for a [[The 1975 (2019 song)|release of "The 1975"]], the theme song of an [[The 1975|English band by the same name]]. Thunberg finishes by urging: "So, everyone out there, it is now time for civil disobedience. It is time to rebel." Proceeds will go to [[Extinction Rebellion]] at Thunberg's request.&lt;ref name="snapes-2019"&gt;{{cite news |last= Snapes |first= Laura|title= 'Time to rebel': Greta Thunberg adds voice to new song by the 1975|date= 25 July 2019 |work= The Guardian |url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/25/time-to-rebel-greta-thunberg-makes-musical-debut-on-the-1975-track |access-date= 25 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transatlantic voyage ===
{{Main|Voyage of Greta Thunberg}}

In August 2019, Thunberg sailed across the Atlantic Ocean from Plymouth, UK, to New York, US, in a 60&amp;nbsp;ft racing yacht equipped with solar panels and underwater turbines. The trip was announced as a carbon neutral transatlantic crossing serving as a demonstration of Thunberg's declared beliefs of the importance of reducing emissions.

The voyage lasted 15 days, from 14 to 28 August 2019. While in the Americas, Thunberg will be attending the UN Climate Action Summit in New York City and the COP 25 climate change conference in Santiago, Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Watts |first1=Jonathan |title=Greta Thunberg sets sail for New York on zero-carbon yacht |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/14/greta-thunberg-sets-sail-plymouth-climate-us-trump |website=The Guardian |accessdate=September 1, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NEWS-CNN(2019-08-28)"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/28/us/greta-thunberg-new-york-landfall-scli-intl/index.html |title=Greta Thunberg reaches New York after 15-day yacht journey |last=Picheta |first=Rob  |access-date=2019-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== School strike for climate ==
{{Main|School strike for climate}}

=== Inspiration ===
[[File:Greta Thunberg 4.jpg|thumb|Thunberg in front of the [[Riksdag|Swedish parliament]], holding a "Skolstrejk för klimatet" ({{translation|School strike for the climate}}) sign, [[Stockholm]], August 2018]]

[[File:Follow Greta! Strike for climate, placard, 2018 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Sign in [[Berlin]], 14 December 2018]]

In an interview with [[Amy Goodman]] from ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', Thunberg said she first got the idea of a climate strike after [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting|school shootings in the United States in February 2018]] led to several youths refusing to go back to school.&lt;ref name="Democracy Now"&gt;{{cite interview |url=https://www.democracynow.org/2018/12/11/meet_the_15_year_old_swedish |title=School Strike for Climate: Meet 15-Year-Old Activist Greta Thunberg, Who Inspired a Global Movement |last=Thunberg|first=Greta |interviewer=[[Amy Goodman]]|website=[[Democracy Now!]] |date=11 December 2018|accessdate=2019-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These teen activists at [[Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School]] in [[Parkland, Florida]] went on to organize the [[March for Our Lives]] in support of greater [[gun control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |title=Teen activist on climate change: If we don't do anything right now, we're screwed |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGmBkIUwYkA |last=Thunberg|first=Greta |interviewer=[[Fareed Zakaria]]|agency=[[CNN]] |via=YouTube|date=23 December 2018|access-date=10 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Guardian view on teenage activists: protesters not puppets |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/07/the-guardian-view-on-teenage-activists-look-whos-pulling-the-strings |access-date=11 February 2019 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=7 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then in May 2018, Thunberg won a climate change essay competition held by Swedish newspaper ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]''. In part she wrote that, “I want to feel safe. How can I feel safe when I know we are in the greatest crisis in human history?”&lt;ref name="NEWS-Wired(6-6-2019)" /&gt; The paper published her article after which she was contacted by Bo Thorén from Fossil Free Dalsland, a group interested in doing something about climate change. Thunberg attended a few of their meetings, and at one of them, Thoren also suggested that school children could strike for climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.goodthingsguy.com/opinion/greta-thunberg/ |title=Greta Thunberg: School strike for climate and to save the world! |date=5 May 2019 |website=Good Things Guy |access-date=12 May 2019|last=Lindeque|first=Brent }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunberg tried to persuade other young people to get involved but "no one was really interested" so eventually, she decided to go ahead with the strike by herself.&lt;ref name="Democracy Now"/&gt;

=== Beginning ===
On 20 August 2018, Thunberg, who had just started ninth grade, decided to not attend school until the [[2018 Swedish general election]] on 9 September after the [[2018 European heat wave|heat waves]] and [[2018 Sweden wildfires|wildfires]] during Sweden's hottest summer in 262 years.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Her demands were that the Swedish government reduce carbon emissions in accordance with the [[Paris Agreement]], and she protested by sitting outside the [[Riksdag]] every day for three weeks during school hours with the sign ''Skolstrejk för klimatet'' (school strike for the climate).&lt;ref name="Newyorker1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-fifteen-year-old-climate-activist-who-is-demanding-a-new-kind-of-politics |title=The Fifteen-Year-Old Climate Activist Who Is Demanding a New Kind of Politics |date=2 October 2018 |newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]|last=Gessen|first=Masha |authorlink=Masha Gessen|accessdate=2019-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also handed out leaflets that stated: "I am doing this because you adults are shitting on my future."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;
==== The role of social media ====

Thunberg posted her original strike photo on Instagram and Twitter and other social media accounts quickly took up her cause.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.co.uk/article/greta-thunberg-climate-crisis Greta Thunberg: How one teenager became the voice of the planet,] Wired, August 2019&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ingmar Rentzhog, founder of a Swedish climate-focused social media company, ''We Don't Have Time'' (WDHT), her strike began attracting public attention after he turned up with a freelance photographer and then posted Thunberg's photograph on his Facebook page and [[Instagram]] account. He also made a video in English that he posted on the company's [[YouTube]] channel that had almost 88,000 views.&lt;ref name="TheLocal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thelocal.se/20190209/start-up-used-child-climate-activist-to-raise-millions |title=Start-up used teen climate activist to raise millions: Swedish paper |newspaper=[[The Local]] |date=9 February 2019|accessdate=2019-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A representative of the Finnish bank, Nordea, quoted one of Thunberg's tweets to more than 200,000 followers. Thunberg's social media profile attracted local reporters whose stories earned international coverage in little more than a week.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.co.uk/article/greta-thunberg-climate-crisis Greta Thunberg: How one teenager became the voice of the planet,] Wired, August 2019&lt;/ref&gt;

After the general elections, Thunberg continued to strike only on Fridays. She inspired school students across the globe to take part in student strikes.&lt;ref name="Guardian2"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Damian |last=Carrington |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/04/leaders-like-children-school-strike-founder-greta-thunberg-tells-un-climate-summit |title='Our leaders are like children', school strike founder tells climate summit |date=4 December 2018 |newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=2019-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2018, more than 20,000 students had held strikes in at least 270 cities.&lt;ref name="Guardian2"/&gt;

After October 2018, Thunberg's activism evolved from solitary protesting to taking part in demonstrations throughout Europe; making several high profile public speeches; and mobilising her growing number of followers on [[social media]] platforms. By March 2019 she was still staging her regular protests outside the Swedish parliament every Friday, where other students now occasionally join her. Her activism has not interfered with her schoolwork, but she has had less spare time.&lt;ref name="jw01"/&gt;

=== Support ===
In February 2019, 224 academics signed an open letter of support stating they were inspired by the actions of Thunberg and the striking school children in making their voices heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=School climate strike children’s brave stand has our support |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/13/school-climate-strike-childrens-brave-stand-has-our-support |newspaper=The Guardian |date=13 February 2019|accessdate=2019-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] [[António Guterres]] also endorsed the school strikes initiated by Thunberg, admitting that "My generation has failed to respond properly to the dramatic challenge of climate change. This is deeply felt by young people. No wonder they are angry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/15/climate-strikers-urgency-un-summit-world-leaders |title=The climate strikers should inspire us all to act at the next UN summit |date=15 March 2019 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=18 March 2019 |author-link=António Guterres |first=António |last=Guterres}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2019, Thunberg spoke by video link with [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]] who had submitted the [[Green New Deal]] to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in February 2019, which calls for the United States to achieve "net-zero" [[greenhouse gas]]es within a decade. They discussed how it feels when their views are not taken seriously because they are young, and what tactics really work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brockes|first=Emma |authorlink=Emma Brockes|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/29/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-met-greta-thunberg-hope-contagious-climate| title=When Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez met Greta Thunberg: 'Hope is contagious'|work=The Guardian|date=29 June 2019|accessdate=2019-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking at an event in New Zealand in May 2019, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said his generation was "not winning the battle against climate change" and that it's up to youth to "rescue the planet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&amp;objectid=12230530 |title=UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says his generation should have done more on climate change |last=Walls|first=Jason |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=13 May 2019|accessdate=2019-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thunberg's message ==
[[File:Greta Thunberg- World Economic Forum (Davos).webm|thumb|right|thumbtime=05:27|Thunberg promoting her campaign at the 2019 [[World Economic Forum]] in Davos]]
When Thunberg began her protest outside the Swedish Parliament in 2018 at age 15, she had two simple messages - a sign which said "school strike for the climate" and leaflets she handed out which said: "I am doing this because you adults are shitting on my future."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/sep/01/swedish-15-year-old-cutting-class-to-fight-the-climate-crisis The Swedish 15-year-old who's cutting class to fight the climate crisis]". The Guardian. Retrieved 2019-05-12.&lt;/ref&gt; As her protest gained momentum, she was invited to gives speeches at a variety of forums which enabled her to expand on her concerns. So far, she has espoused four interwoven themes. 
*  The first is that the crisis caused by global warming is so serious that humanity is facing an [[Global_catastrophic_risk|existential crisis]],&lt;ref name="politico.eu"&gt;[https://www.politico.eu/article/global-climate-icon-finds-that-political-change-is-complicated/ Climate icon Greta Thunberg finds that political change is ‘complicated’,] Politico, 16 April 2019&lt;/ref&gt; "that will most likely lead to the end of our civilization as we know it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/gretathunbergsweden/posts/853561781678310|title=Greta Thunberg|website=www.facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*  The second is that she holds the current generation of adults responsible,  with statements such as "You are stealing our future".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.democracynow.org/2018/12/13/you_are_stealing_our_future_greta|title=You Are Stealing Our Future: Greta Thunberg, 15, Condemns the World’s Inaction on Climate Change|website=Democracy Now!}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is especially concerned about the impact the climate crisis will have on young people like her. Speaking at Parliament in London she said: "You lied to us. You gave us false hope. You told us that the future was something to look forward to." 
*  Thunberg's third key message is that we need to wake up and change&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/opinion/climate-change-greta-thunberg.html|title=Opinion &amp;#124; The Problem With Greta Thunberg’s Climate Activism|first=Christopher|last=Caldwell|date=2 August 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; because very little is being done to solve the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=greta+thunberg+we+need+to+wake+up&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enNZ703NZ703&amp;oq=greta+thunberg+we+need+to+wake+up&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.22795j0j8&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8|title=greta thunberg we need to wake up - Google Search|website=www.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She says the situation is so dire, we should all be panicking.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |title=I want you to panic: 16-year-old issues climate warning at Davos |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjsLm5PCdVQ&amp;t=2m23s |time=2:23|first=Greta |last=Thunberg |publisher=Guardian News|via=YouTube|date=2019-01-25|accessdate=2019-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Her fourth point is that politicians and decision makers need to listen to the scientists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-48018034/climate-change-activist-greta-thunberg-listen-to-climate-scientists|title='It's an existential crisis.

Thunberg uses graphic analogies to highlight her concerns and speaks bluntly to business and political leaders, often scolding them for their lack of action. For instance, she told a panel of prominent business and political leaders at Davos: "Some people, some companies, some decision makers in particular have known exactly what priceless values they have been sacrificing to continue making unimaginable amounts of money. I think many of you here today belong to that group of people."&lt;ref name="Nation0128"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hertsgaard |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Hertsgaard|title=The Climate Kids Are Coming |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/greta-thunberg-climate-change-davos/ |access-date=14 February 2019 |work=[[The Nation]] |date=28 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to say: "I want you to act as if the house was on fire — because it is".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In London in October 2018, she said: "We're facing an immediate unprecedented crisis that has never been treated as a crisis and our leaders are all acting like children."&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/10/31/our-darkest-hour-declaration-rebellion-new-group-vows-mass-civil-disobedience-save |title='This Is Our Darkest Hour': With Declaration of Rebellion, New Group Vows Mass Civil Disobedience to Save Planet |last=Germanos|first=Andrea |date=31 October 2018 |website=Common Dreams|accessdate=2019-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also points out that the strategies adopted by various Governments to limit global warming to 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C as part of the [[Paris Agreement]] are insufficient and the greenhouse gas emissions curve needs to start declining steeply no later than 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/07/29/deliver-fundamental-message-survival-future-generations-greta-thunberg-sail-atlantic|title=To Deliver 'Fundamental Message' for 'Survival of Future Generations,' Greta Thunberg to Sail Atlantic for Americas|website=Common Dreams}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2019, she told the UK parliament that Britain needs to stop talking in terms of "lowering" emissions and start thinking in terms of eliminating them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/23/greta-thunberg-full-speech-to-mps-you-did-not-act-in-time|title='You did not act in time': Greta Thunberg's full speech to MPs|first=Greta|last=Thunberg|date=23 April 2019|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2019, at a conference of the [[European Economic and Social Committee]], she said that the [[European Union|EU]] must reduce their {{CO2}} emissions by 80% by 2030, double the 40% goal set in Paris.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Carmichael |first=Lachlan |title=Climate activist Thunberg urges EU to double carbon reduction targets |url=https://news.yahoo.com/climate-activist-thunberg-urges-eu-double-carbon-reduction-111042030.html |access-date=22 February 2019 |agency=Agence France-Presse|via=Yahoo!

In a statement she originally posted on her [[Facebook]] page, Thunberg acknowledges that she is not a climate scientist: she is merely a messenger who is repeating what scientists have been communicating to the public for decades, so far without much success. She says if everyone listened to the scientists and acknowledged the facts, "then we (students) could all go back to school".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/02/03/response-lies-and-hate-let-me-make-some-things-clear-about-my-climate-strike |title=In Response to Lies and Hate, Let Me Make Some Things Clear About My Climate Strike |last=Thunberg |first=Greta |date=3 February 2019 |website=[[Common Dreams]] |access-date=22 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to this theme on her trip to New York on the carbon-neutral yacht.

== Honors and awards ==
Before starting her climate strike, Thunberg was one of the winners of ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]''{{'}}s debate article writing competition on the climate for young people in May 2018.&lt;ref name="NEWS-Wired(6-6-2019)"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/greta-thunberg-climate-crisis |title=Greta Thunberg: How one teenager became the voice of the planet |last=Tait |first=Amelia |date=June 6, 2019 |work=Wired |access-date=24 August 2019 |agency="I want to feel safe," she wrote. "How can I feel safe when I know we are in the greatest crisis in human history?"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November, 2018, about three months into her [[school climate strike]], Thunberg was nominated for the ''Children's Climate Prize'', which is awarded by the Swedish electricity company Telge Energi.  However, Thunberg declined to accept the award because many of the finalists would have to fly to Stockholm for the ceremony and a required meeting with one another.&lt;ref name="WEB-Telge(11-5-2018)"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://news.cision.com/telge-energi/r/statement--regarding-greta-thunberg-s-decision-not-to-attend-the-children-s-climate-prize-2018,c2664236 |title=Statement: Regarding Greta Thunberg's decision not to attend the Children's Climate Prize 2018 |date=2019-11-05 |website=Telge Energi |access-date=2019-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NEWS-WashPo(12-15-2018)"&gt;{{cite news |last1=O'Grady |first1=Siobhán |title=Teen activist says leaders not 'mature enough' to take action on climate change |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/12/15/teenage-activist-calls-leaders-not-mature-enough-take-action-climate-change/?noredirect=on |accessdate=25 August 2019 |work=Washington Post |date=December 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, Thunberg was awarded the [[Fryshuset]] scholarship of the Young Role Model of the Year,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.aktuellhallbarhet.se/greta-thunberg-blir-arets-unga-forebild/ |title=Greta Thunberg blir Årets unga förebild |last=Rosengren|first=Lina |date=22 November 2018 |website=Aktuell Hållbarhet |language=sv |access-date=22 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named Thunberg one of the world's 25 most influential teenagers of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://time.com/5463721/most-influential-teens-2018/ |title=TIME's 25 Most Influential Teens of 2018 |work=Time |date=2018-12-07|access-date=22 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the occasion of [[International Women's Day]] Thunberg was proclaimed the [[Swedish Woman of the Year|most important woman of the year in Sweden]] in 2019. The award was based on a survey by the institute ''Inizio'' on behalf of the newspaper ''[[Aftonbladet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Klimaaktivistin Greta Thunberg in Schweden "Frau des Jahres"|language=de |agency=[[Deutsche Presse-Agentur]] |via=''[[Zeit Online]]'' |date=8 March 2019 |url=https://www.zeit.de/news/2019-03/08/klimaaktivistin-greta-thunberg-in-schweden-frau-des-jahres-190308-99-297313 |access-date=8 March 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190309164608/https://www.zeit.de/news/2019-03/08/klimaaktivistin-greta-thunberg-in-schweden-frau-des-jahres-190308-99-297313 |archive-date=8 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 March 2019, she received the German [[Goldene Kamera]] Special Climate Protection award.&lt;ref name="NEWS-DW(3-31-2019)"&gt;{{cite news |last1=(dpa, AFP) |title=Greta Thunberg wins German Golden Camera award |url=https://p.dw.com/p/3FxK2 |accessdate=24 August 2019 |work=Deutsche Welle |date=March 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 April 2019, the Prix Liberté from France's region [[Normandy]], which she received in [[Caen]] on 21 July that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/676ee6416809461e8d5c9e9233adb1c8|title=Teen climate activist gets Normandy’s first Freedom Prize|agency=Associated Press|date=2019-07-21|accessdate=2019-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 April 2019, she shared the Norwegian [[Fritt Ords Prize]], which celebrates freedom of speech, with the [[Nature and Youth]] organization.  The conferring organization, [[Fritt Ord (organization)|Fritt Ord]] noted their determined committed activism even in the face of pervasive online and media harassment.  Thunberg donated her share of the prize money to a lawsuit which seeks to halt Norwegian oil exploration in the [[Arctic]].&lt;ref name="NEWS-TNP(4-24-2019)"&gt;{{cite news |title=Swedish Climate Activist Will Use Prize Money from Norway to Sue Norway |url=https://www.tnp.no/norway/politics/swedish-climate-activist-will-use-prize-money-from-norway-to-sue-norway |accessdate=24 August 2019 |work=The Nordic Page |date=April 24, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 March 2019, two deputies of the [[Riksdag|Swedish parliament]] and three deputies of the [[Storting|Norwegian parliament]] nominated Thunberg as a candidate for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. The nominating politicians explained their decision by arguing that [[global warming]] will be the cause of "wars, conflict and refugees" if nothing is done to halt it. Thunberg responded that she was "honoured and very grateful" for the nomination.&lt;ref name="av01"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/climate-activist-greta-thunberg-nobel-peace-prize_n_5c8a4ab8e4b0fbd7662145a4|title=16-Year-Old Climate Activist Greta Thunberg Nominated For Nobel Peace Prize |last=Vagianos |first=Alanna |date=14 March 2019 |newspaper=[[HuffPost]] |access-date=22 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Thunberg receives the Prize later this year, she will become the youngest person ever to receive it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ecowatch.com/greta-thunberg-nobel-peace-prize-2631637803.html |title=Greta Thunberg—Swedish Teen who Inspired School Climate Strikes—Nominated for Nobel Peace Prize |last=Rosane |first=Olivia |date=14 March 2019 |newspaper=EcoWatch |access-date=22 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 June 2019, [[Amnesty International]] gave her their most prestigious award, the [[Ambassador of Conscience Award]], for her leadership in the climate movement. Thunberg said the prize equally belongs to everyone who has taken part in the Fridays for Future Movement in [[school strike for climate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/06/greta-thunberg-and-fridays-for-future-win-ambassador-of-conscience-2019-award/ |title=Climate activists Greta Thunberg and the Fridays for Future movement honoured with top Amnesty International award |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |date=7 June 2019 |access-date=7 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunberg was awarded a ''doctor honoris causa'' ([[honorary degree]]) by the [[University of Mons]].&lt;ref name="NEWS-BelgianTimes(5-16-2019)"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Schneider |first1=Oscar |title=Belgian university will honour young climate-activist Greta Thunberg |url=https://www.brusselstimes.com/all-news/belgium-all-news/56837/university-of-mons-to-honor-greta-thunberg-nicolas-hulot-nicolas-terne/ |work=The Belgian Times |date=May 16, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
=== "Greta Thunberg effect" ===
Thunberg has inspired a number of her school-aged peers in what has been described as the "Greta Thunberg effect".&lt;ref name="NEWS-BBC(2019-05-03)"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-48114220 |title=The Greta effect? Meet the schoolgirl climate warriors |last=Nevett|first=Joshua |publisher=BBC News |date=2019-05-03|accessdate=2019-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to her outspoken stance, various politicians have also acknowledged the need to focus on climate change. Britain's secretary for the environment, [[Michael Gove]], said: "When I listened to you, I felt great admiration, but also responsibility and guilt. I am of your parents' generation, and I recognise that we haven't done nearly enough to address climate change and the broader environmental crisis that we helped to create." Labour politician [[Ed Miliband]], who was responsible for introducing the [[Climate Change Act 2008]], said: "You have woken us up. We thank you. All the young people who have gone on strike have held up a mirror to our society … you have taught us all a really important lesson. You have stood out from the crowd."&lt;ref name="NEWS-Guaridan(2019-04-23)"/&gt; In June 2019, a [[YouGov]] poll in Britain found that public concern about the environment had soared to record levels in the UK since Thunberg and [[Extinction Rebellion]] had "pierced the bubble of denial".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/10/extinction-rebellion-bubble-denial-climate-crisis |title=Extinction Rebellion’s tactics are working.

In August 2019, a doubling in the number of children's books being published which address the climate crisis was reported, with a similar increase in the sales of such books—all aimed at empowering young people to save the planet. Publishers attribute this to the "Greta Thunberg effect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ferguson|first=Donna |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/11/greta-thunberg-leads-to-boom-in-books-aimed-at-empowering-children-to-save-planet |title=‘Greta effect’ leads to boom in children’s environmental books|work=The Guardian|date=11 August 2019|accessdate=2019-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by Thunberg, wealthy philanthropists and investors from the United States have donated almost half a million pounds to support Extinction Rebellion and school strike groups to establish the Climate Emergency Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://climateemergencyfund.org/|title=ClimateEmergencyFund.org|accessdate=2019-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trevor Neilson]], one of the philanthropists, said the three founders would be contacting friends among the global mega-rich to donate "a hundred times" more in the weeks and months ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Matthew |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/12/us-philanthropists-vow-to-raise-millions-for-climate-activists |title=US philanthropists vow to raise millions for climate activists|work=The Guardian|date=12 July 2019|accessdate=2019-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2019, Thunberg shared a stage with the then [[President of the European Commission]], [[Jean-Claude Juncker]], where he outlined “In the next financial period from 2021 to 2027, every fourth euro spent within the EU budget will go towards action to mitigate climate change”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-teen-activist-idUSKCN1QA1RF |title=Swedish student leader wins EU pledge to spend billions on climate |last=Roth|first=Clare |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=21 February 2019|accessdate=2019-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate issues also played a significant role in European elections in May 2019&lt;ref name="Huggler"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/05/19/europes-greens-sense-moment-climate-takes-centre-stage-elections/ |title=The Greta Thunberg effect?

In June 2019, [[SJ AB|Swedish Railways]] (SJ) reported that the number of Swedes taking the train for domestic journeys had risen by 8% more than the previous year, reflecting growing public concern about the impact of flying on {{CO2}} emissions that is highlighted by Thunberg's refusal to fly to international conferences. Being embarrassed or ashamed to take a plane because of its environmental impact has been described on social media as 'Flygskam' or "Shame of flying", along with the hashtag #jagstannarpåmarken, which translates as #istayontheground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/04/stayontheground-swedes-turn-to-trains-amid-climate-flight-shame|title=#stayontheground: Swedes turn to trains amid climate 'flight shame' |newspaper=The Guardian |last=Henley|first=Jon |date=4 June 2019|accessdate=2019-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/26/greta-thunberg-train-journey-through-europe-flygskam-no-fly|title=Greta Thunberg's train journey through Europe highlights no-fly movement|work=The Guardian |last=Orange|first=Richard |date=26 April 2019|accessdate=4 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By August 2019, ''[[Scientific American]]'' was reporting that Thunberg's detractors have "launched personal attacks", "bash (her) autism", and "increasingly rely on [[ad hominem]] attacks to blunt her influence."&lt;ref name="NEWS-SciAm(2019-08-09)"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-deniers-launch-personal-attacks-on-teen-activist/ |title=Climate Deniers Launch Personal Attacks on Teen Activist |last=News |first=Scott Waldman,E&amp;E |access-date=2019-08-29 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Swedish opinion writer {{ill|Paulina Neuding|sv}} invoked mental health issues to question the idea that Thunberg should be leading climate change activism.&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Powell |first1=Mark |title=Greta Thunberg, child sacrifice |url=https://www.spectator.com.au/2019/04/greta-thunberg-child-sacrifice/ |accessdate=22 August 2019 |work=The Spectator Australia |date=30 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', Aditya Chakrabortty said that columnists including [[Brendan O'Neill (columnist)|Brendan O'Neill]], [[Toby Young]], the blog [[Guido Fawkes (website)|Guido Fawkes]], as well as [[Helen Dale]] and [[Rod Liddle]] at ''[[The Spectator]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' had been making "ugly personal attacks" on Thunberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/01/greta-thunberg-right-environmental-activist-attacks |title=The hounding of Greta Thunberg is proof that the right has run out of ideas |last=Chakrabortty |first=Aditya |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 May 2019|accessdate=2019-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its [[climate change denial]], Germany's [[Alternative for Germany]] party has attacked Thunberg "in fairly vicious ways", according to Jakob Guhl, a researcher for the [[Institute for Strategic Dialogue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/14/germanys-afd-attacks-greta-thunberg-as-it-embraces-climate-denial |title=Germany’s AfD turns on Greta Thunberg as it embraces climate denial |last=Connolly|first=Kate |newspaper=The Guardian |date=14 May 2019|accessdate=2019-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thunberg has also been criticised by the Australian climate-change denier [[Andrew Bolt]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Meade|first=Amanda
|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/02/greta-thunberg-hits-back-at-andrew-bolt-for-deeply-disturbing-column |title=Greta Thunberg hits back at Andrew Bolt for 'deeply disturbing' column|work=The Guardian|date=1 August 2019|accessdate=2019-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; after Thunberg announced she would travel to the United States in a carbon-zero yacht. Bolt said she had a cult following, calling her "freakishly influential".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.heraldsun.com.au/blogs/andrew-bolt/the-disturbing-secret-to-the-cult-of-greta-thunberg/news-story/55822063e3589e02707fbb5a9a75d4cc|title=THE DISTURBING SECRET TO THE CULT OF GRETA THUNBERG|date=31 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]] funder [[Arron Banks]]&lt;ref name="Busby"/&gt; was criticised for joking on Twitter about the potential of her encountering an accident on her journey.&lt;ref name="Hinsliff"/&gt;

==== Response to ad hominem attacks ====
Banks' comments outraged a number of MPs (Member of Parliament), celebrities and academics. Prof [[Tanja Bueltmann]], founder of EU Citizens' Champion, said Banks had "invoked the drowning of a child" for his own amusement, and noted that most of those attacking Thunberg "are white middle-aged men from the right of the political spectrum".&lt;ref name="Busby"&gt;{{cite news|last=Busby|first=Mattha |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/15/arron-banks-jokes-about-greta-thunberg-and-freak-yachting-accidents |title=Arron Banks jokes about Greta Thunberg and 'freak yachting accidents'|work=The Guardian|date=15 August 2019|accessdate=2019-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''The Guardian'', [[Gaby Hinsliff]], said Thunberg has become "the new front in the Brexit culture war" arguing that the outrage generated by personal attacks on Thunberg by Brexiteers "gives them the welcome oxygen of publicity".&lt;ref name="Hinsliff"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hinsliff |first=Gaby |authorlink=Gaby Hinsliff|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/17/greta-thunberg-brexit-culture-war-nigel-farage |title=How Greta Thunberg became the new front in the Brexit culture war |work=The Guardian |date=17 August 2019|accessdate=2019-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; British philosopher [[Julian Baggini]] said 'thuggish' personal criticisms of Thunberg are indicative of "a moral and intellectual bankruptcy".&lt;ref name="Baggini" /&gt;

Essayist [[Steve Silberman]], writing in ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'', points out that being on the autism spectrum enables Thunberg to be fearless in her rhetoric.&lt;ref name="Vox"&gt;{{cite web |last=Silberman |first=Steve |authorlink=Steve Silberman|title=Greta Thunberg became a climate activist not in spite of her autism, but because of it |url=https://www.vox.com/first-person/2019/5/6/18531551/autism-greta-thunberg-speech |website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |access-date=7 May 2019 |date=6 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with Suyin Haynes in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, she addressed the criticism she has received online saying: "It's quite hilarious when the only thing people can do is mock you, or talk about your appearance or personality, as it means they have no argument or nothing else to say."&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt;

==== Criticism of Thunberg's campaign ====
In an opinion column, [[Christopher Caldwell (journalist)|Christopher Caldwell]] has claimed that Thunberg's simplistic, straightforward approach to climate change will bring climate protesters into conflict with the complexities of decision-making in western democracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Caldwell|first=Christopher |authorlink=Christopher Caldwell (journalist) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/opinion/climate-change-greta-thunberg.html |title=The Problem With Greta Thunberg’s Climate Activism|work=The New York Times|date=2 August 2019|accessdate=2019-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fair.org/extra/who-gets-to-review-and-be-reviewed/ |title=Who Gets to Review and Be Reviewed? |last=Rendall |first=Steve |date=August 1, 2010 |website=[[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] |quote=Like-wise, (New York) Times reviewers spanned the ideological spectrum, including Patrick Cockburn and Paul Hockenos on the left, Roger Cohen and Matt Bai in the center and Ross Douthat and Christopher Caldwell on the right.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French philosopher [[Raphaël Enthoven]] claims that many people "buy virtue" with their support for Thunberg but don't actually do anything to help.&lt;ref name="Baggini"&gt;{{cite news |last=Baggini |first=Julian |authorlink=Julian Baggini |title=Greta Thunberg’s attackers are morally bankrupt, but her deification isn’t helpful|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/19/greta-thunberg-attackers-climate-crisis-activist |accessdate=21 August 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=19 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2019, [[Agence France-Presse]] reported that [[OPEC]] (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) secretary-general [[Mohammed Barkindo]] "complained of what he called 'unscientific' attacks on the oil industry by climate change campaigners, calling them 'perhaps the greatest threat to our industry going forward'", and said he was apparently referring "to the recent wave of school strikes inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg's 'Fridays for Future' movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.afp.com/en/news/826/climate-campaigners-greatest-threat-oil-sector-opec-doc-1i79w11?fbclid=IwAR3FpALRMkGjTH7nWo7E81w-J0z6yWoEbcPCCUd-LOX9UhpuSM-JbEWXFhU |title=Climate campaigners 'greatest threat' to oil sector: OPEC|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=2 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190705220327/https://www.afp.com/en/news/826/climate-campaigners-greatest-threat-oil-sector-opec-doc-1i79w11?fbclid=IwAR3FpALRMkGjTH7nWo7E81w-J0z6yWoEbcPCCUd-LOX9UhpuSM-JbEWXFhU|archive-date=2019-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunberg and other climate activists responded by calling his remarks a badge of honour.&lt;ref name="Watts 2019-07-05"&gt;{{cite news|last=Watts|first=Jonathan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/05/biggest-compliment-yet-greta-thunberg-welcomes-oil-chiefs-greatest-threat-label |title='Biggest compliment yet': Greta Thunberg welcomes oil chief's 'greatest threat' label|work=The Guardian|date=5 July 2019|accessdate=2019-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thunberg 2019-07-21"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jul/21/great-thunberg-you-ask-the-questions-see-us-as-a-threat|title=Greta Thunberg: ‘They see us as a threat because we’re having an impact’|last=Thunberg|first=Greta |work=The Guardian|date=21 July 2019|accessdate=2019-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Misuse of her name ===
In late 2018, Ingmar Rentzhog, who claims to be one of the first to publicize Thunberg's climate strike, asked her to become an unpaid youth advisor to his climate startup company. He then used her name and image without her knowledge or permission to raise millions for a WDHT for-profit subsidiary, We Don't Have Time AB, of which Rentzhog is the chief executive officer.&lt;ref name="Politico-Feb11"&gt;{{cite news |last=Oroschakoff |first=Kalina |title=Teen climate icon used for fundraising without her knowledge |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/greta-thunberg-teen-climate-icon-used-for-fundraising-without-her-knowledge/ |work=[[Politico Europe]] |date=11 February 2019|accessdate=2019-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunberg received no money from the company.&lt;ref name="TheLocal"/&gt; She terminated her volunteer advisor role with WDHT once she realised they were making money from her name, stating she "is not part of any organization… am absolutely independent… [and] do what I do completely for free."&lt;ref name="GretaFeb2Facebook"&gt;{{cite web |last=Thunberg |first=Greta |title=Recently I’ve seen many rumors… |url=https://www.facebook.com/732846497083173/posts/767646880269801/ |via=[[Facebook]] |access-date=15 February 2019 |date=2 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public demonstrations ===
[[File:Greta Thunberg at the Parliament (33744056408) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Thunberg at the European Parliament in April 2019]]

Thunberg participated in the Rise for Climate demonstration outside the [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]]. In [[London]] in October 2018, she addressed the 'Declaration of Rebellion' organized by [[Extinction Rebellion]] opposite the [[Houses of Parliament]]. She said: "We're facing an immediate unprecedented crisis that has never been treated as a crisis and our leaders are all acting like children. We need to wake up and change everything".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rizvi |first=Husna |title=For climate action, ‘mass civil disobedience’ is the only way |url=https://newint.org/features/2018/11/01/climate-breakdown |access-date=15 February 2019 |work=[[New Internationalist]] |date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== TEDxStockholm ===
On 24 November 2018, she spoke at TEDxStockholm.&lt;ref name="YouTube-Thunberg(2018-11-24)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WEB-Tedx(2018-11-24)"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/31825 |title=TEDxStockholm Theme: Wonderland |date=2018-11-24 |publisher=TED |access-date=20 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She spoke about realizing, when she was eight years old, that [[global warming|climate change]] existed and wondering why it was not headline news on every channel, as if there was a world war going on. She said she did not go to school to become a climate scientist, as some suggested, because the science was done and only denial, ignorance, and inaction remained. Speculating that her children and grandchildren would ask her why they had not taken action in 2018 when there was still time, she concluded with "we can't change the world by playing by the rules, because the rules have to be changed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jones |first=Nigel |title=Why we all need to be more like Greta |url=https://medium.com/nine-by-five-media/why-we-all-need-to-be-more-like-greta-ba36abec961 |access-date=15 February 2019 |work=Nine by Five Media |publisher=[[Medium (website)|Medium]] |date=30 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== COP24 summit ===
Thunberg addressed the [[COP24]] United Nations climate change summit on 4 December 2018,&lt;ref name="Guardian2"/&gt; and also spoke before the plenary assembly on 12 December 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Thunberg |first=Greta |title=You Are Stealing Our Future: Greta Thunberg, 15, Condemns the World's Inaction on Climate Change |url=https://www.democracynow.org/2018/12/13/you_are_stealing_our_future_greta |website=Democracy Now! |date=13 December 2018|access-date=2019-07-22 |quote=You only speak of a green eternal economic growth because you are too scared of being unpopular.

=== Davos ===
On 23 January 2019, Thunberg arrived in [[Davos]] after a 32-hour train journey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Larson |first=Nina |title=Time to 'get angry', teen climate activist says in Davos |url=https://news.yahoo.com/time-angry-teen-climate-activist-says-davos-015904861.html |access-date=24 January 2019 |via=[[Yahoo!

I think many of you here today belong to that group of people."&lt;ref name="Nation0128"/&gt;

Later in the week, she warned the global leaders that "I don't want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day. And then I want you to act. I want you to act as you would in a crisis. I want you to act as if the house was on fire—because it is".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; She wrote in an article for ''[[The Guardian]]'' in January 2019: "According to the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), we are less than 12 years away from not being able to undo our mistakes. In that time, unprecedented changes in all aspects of society need to have taken place, including a reduction of our [[carbon dioxide|{{CO2}}]] emissions by at least 50%".&lt;ref name="Our house is on fire"/&gt;

=== European Economic and Social Committee ===
On 21 February 2019, she spoke at a conference of the [[European Economic and Social Committee]] and to [[European Commission]] chief [[Jean-Claude Juncker]], where she said that to limit global warming to less than the two degrees C goal established at the [[Paris Agreement]], the [[European Union|EU]] must reduce their {{CO2}} emissions by 80% by 2030, double the 40% goal set in Paris. "If we fail to do so" she said, "all that will remain of our political leaders' legacy will be the greatest failure of human history." Later, she joined 7,500 Belgian students in a climate protest in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Swedish teen leads Belgian students on 7th climate march |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=21 February 2019 |url=https://www.apnews.com/dfeaa0852ec64745be81884d0aab0114 |access-date=2019-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Berlin ===
[[File:FFF Berlin 2019-03-29 262 Greta Thunberg.webm|thumb|Thunberg speaking in front of the Brandenburg Gate on 29 March 2019]]
In the weekend 29–31 March 2019, Thunberg visited Berlin. She spoke in front of some 25,000 people near the [[Brandenburg Gate]] on Friday, where she argued that "We live in a strange world where children must sacrifice their own education in order to protest against the destruction of their future. Where the people who have contributed the least to this crisis are the ones who are going to be affected the most."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pressenza.com/2019/03/fridays-for-future-25000-demonstrate-in-berlin-with-greta-thunberg/ |title=Fridays the &amp;#91;''sic''&amp;#93; for Future: 25000 demonstrate in Berlin with Greta Thunberg |last=Thumiger |first=Reto |date=31 March 2019 |agency=Pressenza |access-date=5 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the speech, Thunberg and fellow climate activist [[Luisa Neubauer]] visited the [[Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research]] and met with scientists there. On Saturday, Thunberg received the '[[Goldene Kamera|Golden Camera]]' Special Award on Germany's annual film and television award show. In her acceptance speech at the gala, Thunberg urged celebrities everywhere to use their influence and do their fair share of climate activism to help her.&lt;ref name="el01"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.insidescandinavianbusiness.com/article.php?id=371 |title=Greta Thunberg Wins German Award |last=Lindgren |first=Emma |date=2 April 2019 |website=Inside Scandinavian Business |access-date=9 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/greta-thunberg-joins-german-students-climate-protest-berlin |title=Greta Thunberg joins German students for climate protest in Berlin |last1=Waldholz |first1=Rachel |last2=Wehrmann |first2=Benjamin |date=29 March 2019 |website=Clean Energy Wire |access-date=5 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.plantbasednews.org/post/greta-thunberg-celebrities-face-climate-crisis |title=Greta Thunberg Calls Out Celebrities To Face Climate Crisis In Powerful Speech |last=Gilliver |first=Liam |date=4 April 2019 |website=Plant Based News |access-date=12 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== EU leaders ===
At an April 2019 meeting at the [[European Parliament]] in Strasbourg with MEPs and EU officials, she chided those present "for three emergency [[Brexit]] summits and no emergency summit regarding the breakdown of the climate and the environment". Climate change discussions have not been dominant at EU summits because other issues have taken precedence.&lt;ref name="Rankin"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rankin |first=Jennifer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/16/greta-thunberg-urges-eu-leaders-wake-up-climate-change-school-strike-movement |title=Forget Brexit and focus on climate change, Greta Thunberg tells EU |newspaper=The Guardian |date=16 April 2019 |access-date=24 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said the world is facing its “sixth mass extinction” and said: "We have not treated this crisis as a crisis; we see it as another problem that needs to be fixed. But it is so much more than that. It’s an existential crisis, more important than anything else."&lt;ref name="Rankin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="politico.eu"/&gt;

=== Austrian World Summit R20 ===
In May 2019, Thunberg met with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], United Nations Secretary-General [[António Guterres]], and Austrian President [[Alexander Van der Bellen]] at the launch of a conference organised by Schwarzenegger to speed up progress toward the Paris Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.energylivenews.com/2019/05/29/greta-thunberg-and-arnie-team-up-to-terminate-climate-change/ |title=Greta Thunberg and Arnie team up to terminate climate change |website=Energy Live News|last=Bairstow|first=Jonny |date=2019-05-29|accessdate=2019-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quoting the most recent IPCC report she said: "If we haven't made the changes required by approximately the year 2030, we will probably set off an irreversible chain reaction beyond human control. Then we will pass a point of no return which will be catastrophic." 17,000 people attended the event from 30 different countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ0D-ZSgLis |title=Greta Thunberg Joins Arnold Schwarzenegger &amp; More To Deliver Speeches On Climate |work=Time|via=YouTube|date=2019-05-28|accessdate=2019-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
