'''Naomi Klein''' (born May 5, 1970 &lt;ref&gt;Date of birth [http://www.fullspectrumottawa.com/authors/naomi_klein.php]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Canadian]] [[journalist]], [[author]] and [[Activism|activist]]. She was born into a political family in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], and now lives in [[Toronto]] with her husband [[Avi Lewis]]. 

Her grandfather was fired for [[labour movement|labor]] organizing at [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] in the [[United States]]. Her father Michael, a physician, was a [[Vietnam War]] resister who fled to [[Canada]] and became a member of [[Physicians for Social Responsibility]]. Her film-maker mother, Bonnie, won fame with her [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography]] film, ''Not a Love Story''&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Klein movie: ''[http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC30folder/NotLoveStory.html Not a love story]''&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Her brother Seth is director of the [[Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives]]. Klein's writing career started early with contributions to ''[[The Varsity (newspaper)|The Varsity]]'', a [[University of Toronto]] student newspaper. She credits her wake-up call to [[feminism]] as the [[1989]] [[École Polytechnique massacre]] of female engineering students.

In [[2000]], Klein published the book ''[[No Logo]]'', which for many became a [[manifesto]] of the [[anti-globalization movement]]. This movement had shut down the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO Meeting of 1999]] one month before the release of ''No Logo''. Paradoxically, the book is not about trademark law but lambasts [[brand name|brand]]-oriented [[consumer culture]] by describing the operations of large [[corporation]]s. Their products, she argues, turn people into walking billboards. These corporations are also often guilty of exploiting workers in the world's poorest countries in pursuit of ever-greater profits, she writes. Klein criticized [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] so much in the book that it became one of the first publications to receive feedback from the company.

In [[2002]] Klein published ''Fences and Windows'', a collection of articles and speeches she had written on behalf of the anti-[[globalization]] movement (all proceeds from the book go to benefit activist organizations through The Fences and Windows Fund). Klein also contributes to ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', ''[[In These Times]]'', [[Canada]]'s ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', ''[[This Magazine]]'', and ''[[The Guardian]]''. 

She has continued to write on various current issues, such as the [[occupation of Iraq|war in Iraq]]. In a September 2004 article for ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' entitled "Baghdad Year Zero: Pillaging Iraq in pursuit of a [[neoconservative|neocon]] [[utopia]]", she argues that, contrary to popular belief and criticisms, the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] did have a clear plan for post-invasion Iraq, which was to build a fully unconstrained [[free market economics|free market economy]]. She describes plans to allow foreigners to extract wealth from Iraq, and the methods used to achieve those goals.

Klein gave the annual [[Dalton Camp|Dalton K. Camp]] Lecture in Journalism on [[October 28]], [[2004]] at [[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)|St. Thomas University]] in [[Fredericton, New Brunswick]]. She also spoke at the tenth anniversary celebration of [[Stauffer]] [[Library]] at [[Queen's University, Canada|Queen's University]], [[Kingston, Ontario]] on [[November 4]], [[2004]], and at the Navigating A New World Conference on [[November 6]], along with [[Lloyd Axworthy]], [[Linda McQuaig]], [[Roméo Dallaire]], [[Thomas Homer-Dixon]], and [[Irshad Manji]].

Also in 2004, Klein and her husband, Canadian television journalist [[Avi Lewis]], released a [[documentary film]] called ''[[The Take]]'', which profiled a group of former employees of a bankrupt foundry in [[Argentina]].  Because they were the company's creditors, they used Argentina's bankrupcty rules to take the plant.  It was then run as a [[cooperative]]. But as any other business, it would have to meet all its financial obligations or be subject to claims of creditors just as the former owners had been who lost control of the foundry.

In October 2005, Klein was ranked 11th in the [[The 2005 Global Intellectuals Poll]], a list of the world's top 100 public intellectuals compiled by ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]'' magazine [http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/intellectuals/results] in conjunction with ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine. She was the highest ranked woman on the list. However, Prospect based the list and its rankings entirely on an Internet poll, and explicitly noted that the voters showed a heavy sampling bias toward young North Americans, and that the voting was dominated by active campaigning on the Internet by partisans for particular candidates, in some cases instigated by the candidates themselves.
