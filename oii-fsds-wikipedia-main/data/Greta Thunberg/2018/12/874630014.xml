'''Greta Thunberg''' (born 3 January 2003) is a [[Swedes|Swedish]] climate activist. She is known for [[student strike|striking]] outside the [[Riksdag|Swedish parliament building]] to raise [[climate change]] activism,&lt;ref name="Guardian1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/sep/01/swedish-15-year-old-cutting-class-to-fight-the-climate-crisis |title=The Swedish 15-year-old who's cutting class to fight the climate crisis |date=1 September 2018 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; speaking at TEDxStockholm, and addressing the [[COP24]] UN climate conference.

== Life ==
Thunberg was born on 3 January 2003. Her mother is [[Malena Ernman]], a Swedish opera singer. Thunberg's father is Svante Thunberg, who is an actor named after [[Svante Arrhenius]]. Arrhenius is an ancestor of her father, and won a [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for calculating the effects of [[greenhouse gas]]es in the [[atmosphere of earth|atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.democracynow.org/2018/12/11/meet_the_15_year_old_swedish|title=School Strike for Climate: Meet 15-Year-Old Activist Greta Thunberg, Who Inspired a Global Movement|website=Democracy Now!}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian2"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/04/leaders-like-children-school-strike-founder-greta-thunberg-tells-un-climate-summit |title='Our leaders are like children,' school strike founder tells climate summit |date=4 December 2018 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her grandfather is [[Olof Thunberg]], an actor and a director.

Greta Thunberg has been diagnosed with [[Asperger's syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Newyorker1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-fifteen-year-old-climate-activist-who-is-demanding-a-new-kind-of-politics |title=The Fifteen-Year-Old Climate Activist Who Is Demanding a New Kind of Politics |date=2 October 2018 |website=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism ==
On 20 August 2018, Thunberg, then in ninth grade, decided to not attend school until the [[Swedish general election, 2018|2018 Sweden general election]] on 9 September after [[2018 European heat wave|heat waves]] and [[2018 Sweden wildfires|wildfires]] in Sweden.&lt;ref name="Guardian1"/&gt; Her demands were that the Sweden government reduce carbon emissions as per the [[Paris Agreement]], and she protested via sitting outside the [[Riksdag]] every day during school hours with the sign "''Skolstrejk för klimatet''" (school strike for the climate).&lt;ref name="Newyorker1" /&gt;

After the general elections, she continued to strike only on Fridays, which gained worldwide attention. Similar protests were organized in other countries, including The Netherlands, Germany, Finland and Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/klimat/klimatmanifestation-over-hela-landet-odesfraga/ |title=Klimatmanifestation över hela landet: ”Ödesfråga” |date=30 November 2018 |work=[[Expressen]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, thousands of school students were inspired by Thunberg to strike on Fridays, ignoring Prime Minister [[Scott Morrison]]'s comments of " more learning in schools and less activism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://edition-m.cnn.com/2018/11/30/australia/australia-school-climate-strike-scli-intl/index.html?r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.co.in%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dclimate%2Bstrike%2BAustralia%26client%3Ducweb-b%26channel%3Dsb |title=Australian school children defy prime minister with climate strike |date=30 November 2018 |work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Twitter]], she used hashtags and spread online awareness. Thunberg participated in the Rise for Climate demonstration outside the [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]] and the Declaration of Rebellion organized by [[Extinction Rebellion]] in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/10/31/our-darkest-hour-declaration-rebellion-new-group-vows-mass-civil-disobedience-save |title=This Is Our Darkest Hour: With Declaration of Rebellion, New Group Vows Mass Civil Disobedience to Save Planet |date=31 October 2018 |work=Common Dreams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 November 2018, she spoke at [[TED (conference)#TEDx|TEDxStockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TEDxStockholm Theme: Wonderland |url=https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/31825 |publisher=TED |accessdate=20 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the conclusion of her talk, Thunberg said, "We've had thirty years of pep-talking and selling positive ideas. And I'm sorry, but it doesn't work. Because if it would have, the emissions would have gone down by now—they haven't."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jon |first1=Queally |title=Depressed and Then Diagnosed With Autism, Greta Thunberg Explains Why Hope Cannot Save Planet But Bold Climate Action Still Can |url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/12/19/depressed-and-then-diagnosed-autism-greta-thunberg-explains-why-hope-cannot-save |publisher=Common Dreams |accessdate=20 December 2018 |date=2018-12-19 |quote=Towards the conclusion of her talk, Thunberg says that "this is when people usually start talking about hope—solar panels, wind power, circular economy, and so on—but I'm not going to do that."  And continues, "We've had thirty years of pep-talking and selling positive ideas. And I'm sorry, but it doesn't work. Because if it would have, the emissions would have gone down by now—they haven't."   Finally, she says: "Yes, we do need hope—of course, we do. But the one thing we need more than hope is action. Once we start to act, hope is everywhere."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December 2018, Thunberg addressed the [[COP24]] United Nations climate change summit.&lt;ref name="carrington-2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Carrington |first1 = Damian |title = 'Our leaders are like children', school strike founder tells climate summit |date = 4 December 2018 |work = The Guardian |location = London, United Kingdom |issn = 0261-3077 |url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/04/leaders-like-children-school-strike-founder-greta-thunberg-tells-un-climate-summit |access-date = 2018-12-04}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  On 12 December 2018, Thunberg again addressed the COP24 plenary assembly, stating:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Greta Thunberg makes an impassioned appeal at UN climate change conference in Poland |url=https://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/world/greta-thunberg-un-climate-change-conference-in-poland/video/ae124de8e21fc55c4027281c09d22fe4?fbclid=IwAR3dT9NrkNT7FieDb7fcpFH1M-L31HIx7AUEUDDC6wq_4RHuTpXQ2pPvtVY |website=Herald Sun |publisher=NewsCorp Australia |accessdate=13 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Thunberg |first1=Greta |title=You Are Stealing Our Future: Greta Thunberg, 15, Condemns the World's Inaction on Climate Change |url=https://www.democracynow.org/2018/12/13/you_are_stealing_our_future_greta |website=Democracy Now! |accessdate=13 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
