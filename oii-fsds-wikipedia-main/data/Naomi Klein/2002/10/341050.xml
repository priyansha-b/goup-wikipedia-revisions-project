She is the author of [[No Logo]] ([[2000]]) and the soon-to-be-published [[Fences and Windows]], which is to a certain extent a [[manifesto]] of the [[anti-globalization movement]]. She also writes for [[Canada]]'s [[The Globe and Mail]] and [[The Guardian]] in Britain.

Her book, [[No Logo]] was one of the first publications to recieve feedback from [[Nike]], a company she oft-criticises throughout the book.
