She is the author of ''[[No Logo]]'' ([[2000]]), which is to a certain extent a [[manifesto]] of the [[anti-globalization movement]]. And ''[[Fences and Windows]]'' ([[2002]]). She also writes for [[Canada]]'s ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' in Britain.

Her book ''[[No Logo]]'' was one of the first publications to receive feedback from [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], a company she oft-criticises throughout the book.
