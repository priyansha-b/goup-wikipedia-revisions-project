Thunberg first became known for [[youth activism]] in August 2018 when, at age 15, she began spending her school days outside the [[Swedish parliament]] to call for stronger [[Climate change mitigation|action on global warming]] by holding up a sign saying (in Swedish) "School strike for the climate". Soon, other students engaged in similar protests in their own communities. Together, they organised a [[school climate strike]] movement under the name Fridays for Future. After Thunberg addressed the [[2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference]], student strikes took place every week somewhere in the world. In 2019, there were at least two coordinated multi-city protests involving over 1,000,000 students each.&lt;ref name="WEB-HPR(2019-03-19)"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://harvardpolitics.com/united-states/youth-demand-climate-action-in-global-school-strike/ |title=Youth Demand Climate Action in Global School Strike |last=Cohen |first=Ilana |last2=Heberle |first2=Jacob |date=19 March 2019 |website=[[Harvard Political Review]] |language=en |access-date=30 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190705183307/http://harvardpolitics.com/united-states/youth-demand-climate-action-in-global-school-strike/ |archive-date=5 July 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NEWS-Time(2019-05-24)"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://time.com/5595365/global-climate-strikes-greta-thunberg/ |title=Students From 1,600 Cities Just Walked Out of School to Protest Climate Change.

In an interview with [[Amy Goodman]] from ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', Thunberg said she first got the idea of a climate strike after [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting|school shootings in the United States in February 2018]] led to several youths refusing to go back to school.&lt;ref name="Democracy Now"&gt;{{cite interview |url=https://www.democracynow.org/2018/12/11/meet_the_15_year_old_swedish |title=School Strike for Climate: Meet 15-Year-Old Activist Greta Thunberg, Who Inspired a Global Movement |last=Thunberg |first=Greta |interviewer=[[Amy Goodman]] |website=[[Democracy Now!]] |date=11 December 2018 |accessdate=22 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190717102212/https://www.democracynow.org/2018/12/11/meet_the_15_year_old_swedish |archive-date=17 July 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; These teen activists at [[Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School]] in [[Parkland, Florida]], went on to organise the [[March for Our Lives]] in support of greater [[gun control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |title=Teen activist on climate change: If we don't do anything right now, we're screwed |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGmBkIUwYkA |last=Thunberg |first=Greta |interviewer=[[Fareed Zakaria]] |agency=[[CNN]] |via=YouTube |date=23 December 2018|access-date=10 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190315172703/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGmBkIUwYkA|archive-date=15 March 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Guardian view on teenage activists: protesters not puppets |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/07/the-guardian-view-on-teenage-activists-look-whos-pulling-the-strings |access-date=11 February 2019 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=7 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190211043029/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/07/the-guardian-view-on-teenage-activists-look-whos-pulling-the-strings |archive-date=11 February 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, Thunberg won a climate change essay competition held by Swedish newspaper ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]''. In part, she wrote that "I want to feel safe. How can I feel safe when I know we are in the greatest crisis in human history?”&lt;ref name="NEWS-Wired(6-6-2019)" /&gt; After the paper published her article she was contacted by Bo Thorén from Fossil Free Dalsland, a group interested in doing something about climate change. Thunberg attended a few of their meetings; and at one of them Thorén also suggested that school children could strike for climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.goodthingsguy.com/opinion/greta-thunberg/ |title=Greta Thunberg: School strike for climate and to save the world! |date=5 May 2019 |website=Good Things Guy |access-date=12 May 2019 |last=Lindeque |first=Brent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunberg tried to persuade other young people to get involved but "no one was really interested", so eventually she decided to go ahead with the strike by herself.&lt;ref name="Democracy Now"/&gt;

On 20 August 2018, Thunberg, who had just started ninth grade, decided not to attend school until the [[2018 Swedish general election]] on 9 September; her protest began after the [[2018 European heat wave|heat waves]] and [[2018 Sweden wildfires|wildfires]] during Sweden's hottest summer in at least 262 years.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Her demands were that the Swedish government reduce carbon emissions in accordance with the [[Paris Agreement]], and she protested by sitting outside the [[Riksdag]] every day for three weeks during school hours with the sign ''Skolstrejk för klimatet'' (school strike for the climate).&lt;ref name="Newyorker1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-fifteen-year-old-climate-activist-who-is-demanding-a-new-kind-of-politics |title=The Fifteen-Year-Old Climate Activist Who Is Demanding a New Kind of Politics |date=2 October 2018 |newspaper=[[The New Yorker]] |last=Gessen |first=Masha |authorlink=Masha Gessen |accessdate=22 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190105223945/https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-fifteen-year-old-climate-activist-who-is-demanding-a-new-kind-of-politics |archive-date=5 January 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.techwarrant.com/time-person-of-the-year-is-greta-thunberg/ |title=Time Person Of The Year Is Greta Thunberg |date=12 December 2019 |newspaper=Tech Warrant |accessdate=15 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191215212835/https://www.techwarrant.com/time-person-of-the-year-is-greta-thunberg/ |archive-date=15 December 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thunberg posted her original strike photo on Instagram and Twitter, and other social media accounts quickly took up her cause.&lt;ref name="wired.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/greta-thunberg-climate-crisis |first=Amelia |last=Tait |title=Greta Thunberg: How one teenager became the voice of the planet |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190823154313/https://www.wired.co.uk/article/greta-thunberg-climate-crisis |archive-date=23 August 2019 |work=Wired|date=6 June 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ingmar Rentzhog, founder of a Swedish climate-focused social media company, ''We Don't Have Time'' (WDHT), her strike began attracting public attention after he turned up with a freelance photographer and then posted Thunberg's photograph on his Facebook page and [[Instagram]] account. He also made a video in English that he posted on the company's [[YouTube]] channel that had almost 88,000 views.&lt;ref name="TheLocal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thelocal.se/20190209/start-up-used-child-climate-activist-to-raise-millions |title=Start-up used teen climate activist to raise millions: Swedish paper |newspaper=[[The Local]] |date=9 February 2019 |accessdate=22 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727001257/https://www.thelocal.se/20190209/start-up-used-child-climate-activist-to-raise-millions |archive-date=27 July 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; A representative of the Finnish bank, Nordea, quoted one of Thunberg's tweets to more than 200,000 followers. Thunberg's social media profile attracted local reporters whose stories earned international coverage in little more than a week.&lt;ref name="wired.co.uk"/&gt;

After the general elections, Thunberg continued to strike only on Fridays. She inspired school students across the globe to take part in student strikes.&lt;ref name="Guardian2"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Damian |last=Carrington |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/04/leaders-like-children-school-strike-founder-greta-thunberg-tells-un-climate-summit |title='Our leaders are like children', school strike founder tells climate summit |date=4 December 2018 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=22 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190102050002/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/04/leaders-like-children-school-strike-founder-greta-thunberg-tells-un-climate-summit |archive-date=2 January 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2018, more than 20,000 students had held strikes in at least 270 cities.&lt;ref name="Guardian2"/&gt; The school strikes for climate on 20 and 27 September 2019 were attended by over four million people, according to one of the co-organisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/9/20/20876143/climate-strike-2019-september-20-crowd-estimate |date=22 September 2019 |title=How big was the global climate strike? 4 million people, activists estimate. |work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |author-last1=Barclay |author-first1=Eliza |author-last2=Resnick |author-first2=Brian |access-date=21 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190921012020/https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/9/20/20876143/climate-strike-2019-september-20-crowd-estimate |archive-date=21 September 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After October 2018, Thunberg's activism evolved from solitary protesting to taking part in demonstrations throughout Europe; making several high-profile public speeches, and mobilising her growing number of followers on [[social media]] platforms. By March 2019, she was still staging her regular protests outside the Swedish parliament every Friday, where other students now occasionally join her. Her activism has not interfered with her schoolwork, but she has had less spare time.&lt;ref name="jw01"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/11/greta-thunberg-schoolgirl-climate-change-warrior-some-people-can-let-things-go-i-cant |title=Greta Thunberg, schoolgirl climate change warrior: 'Some people can let things go.

In August 2019, Thunberg sailed across the Atlantic Ocean from [[Plymouth, England|Plymouth]], England, to [[New York City|New York]], USA, in a {{convert|60|ft|m|adj=on}} racing yacht equipped with solar panels and underwater turbines.

In the United States, Thunberg participated in climate protests in New York City, [[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], and the [[Standing Rock Indian Reservation]].

On 13 November 2019, Thunberg departed North America and headed to Spain for the [[2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP25). She set sail from [[Hampton, VA|Hampton]] in Virginia, USA, aboard a {{convert|48|ft|m|adj=on}} catamaran, ''[[Sailing La Vagabonde|La Vagabonde]]''. When it was announced that COP25 was moving from Chile to Spain, Thunberg posted on social media that she needed a ride across the Atlantic Ocean (she refuses to fly due to the carbon emissions from air travel). Thunberg tweeted: "As #COP25 has officially been moved from Santiago to Madrid I'll need some help." "Now I need to find a way to cross the Atlantic in November ... If anyone could help me find transport I would be so grateful." "Help came from Riley Whitelum, an Australian who has been sailing around the world with his wife, Elayna Caraus aboard ''La Vagabonde''." Thunberg's departing message was the same as it has been since she began her activism: "My message to the Americans is the same as to everyone – that is to unite behind the science and to act on the science." "We must realize this is a crisis, and we must do what we can now to spread awareness about this and to put pressure on the people in power. And especially, the US has an election coming up soon, and it's very important that for everyone who can vote, vote."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/climate/greta-thunberg-return-europe.html |title=Greta Thunberg Sets Sail, Again, After Climate Talks Relocate |last=Sengupta |first=Somini |date=12 November 2019 |work=The New York Times|access-date=14 November 2019 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191114072255/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/climate/greta-thunberg-return-europe.html|archive-date=14 November 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-50403488 |work=BBC News |title=Greta Thunberg to sail to climate summit in Spain |date=13 November 2019|access-date=14 November 2019 |language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191114151205/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-50403488|archive-date=14 November 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-13/australian-sailors-taking-greta-thunberg-back-to-un-cop25-summit/11699990 |title=Australian sailing couple and their son come to Greta Thunberg's rescue |last=Shine |first=Rhiannon |last2=Carmody |first2=James |date=13 November 2019 |website=ABC News |language=en-AU|access-date=14 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191114014102/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-13/australian-sailors-taking-greta-thunberg-back-to-un-cop25-summit/11699990|archive-date=14 November 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/12/greta-thunberg-climate-crisis-message-vote |title=Greta Thunberg leaves US with simple climate crisis message: vote |last=Holden |first=Emily |date=12 November 2019 |work=The Guardian|access-date=14 November 2019 |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191114103555/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/12/greta-thunberg-climate-crisis-message-vote|archive-date=14 November 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2019, 224 academics signed an open letter of support stating they were inspired by the actions of Thunberg and the striking school children in making their voices heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=School climate strike children's brave stand has our support |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/13/school-climate-strike-childrens-brave-stand-has-our-support |newspaper=The Guardian |date=13 February 2019 |accessdate=22 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190825072245/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/13/school-climate-strike-childrens-brave-stand-has-our-support |archive-date=25 August 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] [[António Guterres]] also endorsed the school strikes initiated by Thunberg, admitting that "My generation has failed to respond properly to the dramatic challenge of climate change.

=== "The Greta effect" ===

[[File:GrèveClimatGenève-27sept2019-041-RuesBasses.jpg|thumb|[[September 2019 climate strike]] in Geneva]]
Thunberg has inspired a number of her school-aged peers in what has been described as "The Greta effect".&lt;ref name="NEWS-BBC(2019-05-03)"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-48114220 |title=The Greta effect?

Britain's secretary for the environment, [[Michael Gove]], said: "When I listened to you, I felt great admiration, but also responsibility and guilt. I am of your parents' generation, and I recognise that we haven't done nearly enough to address climate change and the broader environmental crisis that we helped to create." Labour politician [[Ed Miliband]], who was responsible for introducing the [[Climate Change Act 2008]], said: "You have woken us up. We thank you. All the young people who have gone on strike have held up a mirror to our society … you have taught us all a really important lesson. You have stood out from the crowd."&lt;ref name="NEWS-Guardian(2019-04-23)"/&gt; In June 2019, a [[YouGov]] poll in Britain found that public concern about the environment had soared to record levels in the UK since Thunberg and [[Extinction Rebellion]] had "pierced the bubble of denial".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/10/extinction-rebellion-bubble-denial-climate-crisis |title=Extinction Rebellion's tactics are working.

In August 2019, publication and sales of children's books about the climate crisis reportedly doubled.

In February 2019, Thunberg shared a stage with the then [[President of the European Commission]], [[Jean-Claude Juncker]], where he outlined "In the next financial period from 2021 to 2027, every fourth euro spent within the EU budget will go towards action to mitigate climate change".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-teen-activist-idUSKCN1QA1RF |title=Swedish student leader wins EU pledge to spend billions on climate |last=Roth |first=Clare |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=21 February 2019 |accessdate=22 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190625222613/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-teen-activist-idUSKCN1QA1RF |archive-date=25 June 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate issues also played a significant role in [[2019 European Parliament election|European Parliament election]] in May 2019&lt;ref name="Huggler"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/05/19/europes-greens-sense-moment-climate-takes-centre-stage-elections/ |title=The Greta effect?

In June 2019, [[SJ AB|Swedish Railways]] (SJ) reported that the number of Swedes taking the train for domestic journeys had risen by 8% from the previous year, reflecting growing public concern about the impact of flying on {{CO2}} emissions that is highlighted by Thunberg's refusal to fly to international conferences.

In July 2019, [[Agence France-Presse]] reported that [[OPEC]] (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) secretary-general [[Mohammed Barkindo]] "complained of what he called 'unscientific' attacks on the oil industry by climate change campaigners, calling them 'perhaps the greatest threat to our industry going forward'", in apparent reference to the recent school strikes inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg's 'Fridays for Future' movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.afp.com/en/news/826/climate-campaigners-greatest-threat-oil-sector-opec-doc-1i79w11 |title=Climate campaigners 'greatest threat' to oil sector: OPEC |date=2 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704220750/https://www.afp.com/en/news/826/climate-campaigners-greatest-threat-oil-sector-opec-doc-1i79w11 |archive-date=4 July 2019 |agency=Agence France-Presse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunberg and other climate activists responded by calling his remarks a badge of honour.&lt;ref name="Watts 2019-07-05"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/05/biggest-compliment-yet-greta-thunberg-welcomes-oil-chiefs-greatest-threat-label |title='Biggest compliment yet': Greta Thunberg welcomes oil chief's 'greatest threat' label |last=Watts |first=Jonathan |date=5 July 2019 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=22 July 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721125425/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/05/biggest-compliment-yet-greta-thunberg-welcomes-oil-chiefs-greatest-threat-label|archive-date=21 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thunberg 2019-07-21"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jul/21/great-thunberg-you-ask-the-questions-see-us-as-a-threat |title=Greta Thunberg: 'They see us as a threat because we're having an impact' |last=Thunberg |first=Greta |date=21 July 2019 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=22 July 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721225331/https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jul/21/great-thunberg-you-ask-the-questions-see-us-as-a-threat|archive-date=21 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Thunberg's filing of a lawsuit against France, Germany and other countries which failed to meet their Paris Agreement emission reduction targets, Emmanuel Macron said: "such radical positions (as held by Thunberg) antagonise our societies... She should focus on those that are blocking, those that are the furthest... I don't  feel like either the French or the German governments are trying to block". 

In September 2019, Donald Trump shared a video of Thunberg angrily addressing world leaders, along with a quote of hers that "people are dying, entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a [[Holocene extinction|mass extinction]]". Trump wrote about Thunberg, tweeting: "She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!" Thunberg reacted by changing her Twitter bio to match his description, and stating she could not "understand why grown-ups would choose to mock children and teenagers for just communicating and acting on the science when they could do something good instead."&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources:

In October 2019, Vladimir Putin described Thunberg as a "kind girl and very sincere", while suggesting she was being manipulated to serve others' interests. Putin criticised her as "poorly informed": "No one has explained to Greta that the modern world is complex and different and people in Africa or in many Asian countries want to live at the same wealth level as in Sweden." Similar to her reaction to Trump, Thunberg updated her Twitter bio to reflect Putin's description of her.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources:

In December 2019, Thunberg tweeted "Indigenous people are literally being murdered for trying to protect the forrest {{sic}} from illegal deforestation. Over and over again. It is shameful that the world remains silent about this". When asked about this subject two days later, Brazilian president [[Jair Bolsonaro]] responded: "Greta said that the Indians were dying because they were trying to protect the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]]. It is impressive how the press gives voice to such a brat". On the same day, Thunberg changed her Twitter description to "pirralha", the Portuguese word for "brat" used by Bolsonaro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=10 December 2019 |title=Ativista Greta Thunberg muda descrição no Twitter para 'pirralha' após declaração de Bolsonaro |trans-title=Activist Greta Thunberg changes her Twitter's description to "brat" after Bolsonaro's declaration |url=https://g1.globo.com/natureza/noticia/2019/12/10/ativista-greta-thunberg-muda-descricao-no-twitter-para-pirralha-apos-declaracao-de-bolsonaro.ghtml |language=Portuguese |work=[[G1 (website)|G1]] |access-date=10 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191210155236/https://g1.globo.com/natureza/noticia/2019/12/10/ativista-greta-thunberg-muda-descricao-no-twitter-para-pirralha-apos-declaracao-de-bolsonaro.ghtml |archive-date=10 December 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, President Trump, for a second time, mocked Thunberg after she was named Person of the Year for 2019 by ''Time'' magazine: "So ridiculous," Mr. Trump tweeted. "Greta must work on her anger management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!" Thunberg was quick to respond. "A teenager working on her anger management problem," read a new version of her Twitter biography. "Currently chilling and watching a good old fashioned movie with a friend."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/us/politics/greta-thunberg-trump.html |title=Trump Mocks Greta Thunberg on Twitter, and She Jabs Back |last=Taylor |first=Derrick Bryson |date=12 December 2019 |work=The New York Times|access-date=14 December 2019 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191214194438/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/us/politics/greta-thunberg-trump.html|archive-date=14 December 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Response to attacks on Thunberg ====
