'''Naomi Klein''' is a [[Canadian]] [[journalist]], [[author]] and [[Activism|activist]] well known for her political analyses of corporate [[globalization]].

Klein was born in [[Montreal, Quebec]].  Her family has a history of activism, as does her husband's family.  Her grandfather was fired for [[labour movement|labor]] organizing at [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] in the [[United States]]. Her father Michael, a physician, was a [[Vietnam War]] resister and became a member of [[Physicians for Social Responsibility]]. Her film-maker mother, [[Bonnie Sherr Klein]], won fame with her [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography]] film, ''[[Not a Love Story]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite visual|director=Bonnie Klein |producer=National Film Board of Canada |title=Not a Love Story: A Motion Picture About Pornography}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC30folder/NotLoveStory.html |title=Not a Love Story: The film and the debate |first=Lisa |last=DiCaprio |issue=30 |month=March |year=1985 |pages=39-42 |journal=Jump Cut |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her brother Seth is director of the British Columbia office of the [[Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives]]. Her in-laws are [[Michele Landsberg]] and [[Stephen  Lewis]], son of [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]].  An aunt is married to [[Daniel Libeskind]], the architect.

Klein's writing career started early with contributions to ''[[The Varsity (newspaper)|The Varsity]]'', a [[University of Toronto]] student newspaper, where she served as editor-in-chief. She credits her wake-up call to [[feminism]] as the 1989 [[École Polytechnique massacre]] of female engineering students.  She is a former Miliband Fellow at the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/miliband/visitingTeachingFellows.htm |title=Visiting teaching fellows |publisher=London School of Economics and Political Science |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Klein published the book ''[[No Logo]]'', which for many became a [[manifesto]] of the [[anti-globalization movement]]. This movement had shut down the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO Meeting of 1999]] one month before the release of ''No Logo''. The book lambasts [[brand name|brand]]-oriented [[consumer culture]] by describing the operations of large [[corporation]]s. These corporations are also often guilty of exploiting workers in the world's poorest countries in pursuit of ever-greater profits, she writes. Klein criticized [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] so much in the book that it became one of the first publications to receive feedback from the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010618162615/http://nikebiz.com/labor/nologo_let.shtml  |archivedate=2001-06-18 |url=http://nikebiz.com/labor/nologo_let.shtml |title=Nike's response to ''No Logo'' |date=2000-03-08 |publisher=[[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 Klein published ''Fences and Windows'', a collection of articles and speeches she had written on behalf of the anti-[[globalization]] movement (all proceeds from the book go to benefit activist organizations through The Fences and Windows Fund). Klein also contributes to ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', ''[[In These Times]]'', [[Canada]]'s ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', ''[[This Magazine]]'', and ''[[The Guardian]]''. 

She has continued to write on various current issues, such as the [[occupation of Iraq|war in Iraq]]. In a September 2004 article for ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' entitled "Baghdad Year Zero: Pillaging Iraq in pursuit of a [[neoconservative|neocon]] [[utopia]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harpers.org/BaghdadYearZero.html |title=Baghdad year zero: Pillaging Iraq in pursuit of a neocon utopia |year=2004 |month=September |work=Harper's Magazine |publisher=The Harper's Magazine Foundation |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; she argues that, contrary to popular belief and criticisms, the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] did have a clear plan for post-invasion Iraq, which was to build a fully unconstrained [[free market economics|free market economy]]. She describes plans to allow foreigners to extract wealth from Iraq, and the methods used to achieve those goals.

Also in 2004, Klein and her husband, [[Avi Lewis]], released a [[documentary film]] called ''[[The Take]]'', about factory workers in  [[Argentina]] who took over the closed plant and resumed production, operating as a [[collective]]. The first African screening was in the Kennedy Road shack settlement in the South African city of [[Durban]] where the [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] movement began.

In October 2005, Klein was ranked 11th in the [[The 2005 Global Intellectuals Poll]], a list of the world's top 100 public intellectuals compiled by ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Prospect Magazine List of Top 100 Public Intellectuals |url=http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/intellectuals/results.htm |work=Prospect Magazine |publisher=Prospect Publishing Limited |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; in conjunction with ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine. She was the highest ranked woman on the list. ''Prospect'' based the list and its rankings entirely on an Internet poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Global public intellectuals poll | url=http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=7078 |work=Prospect Magazine |publisher=Prospect Publishing Limited |year=2005 |month=November |first=David |last=Herman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naomi Klein's third book, ''[[The Shock Doctrine]]: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism'', was published on 4 September 2007. The book first discusses the CIA's manual of torture, the Kubark CounterIntelligence Interrogation handbook, describing the process, referred to by Naomi Klein as a shock, of regressing the prisoner down to a childhood state. This shock is used as a metaphor throughout the work for all crisis - natural disasters, wars, terrorist attacks - which, because of the psychological shock, allow opportunistic dramatical economical reforms, referred to as economical shocks. A criticism of [[Milton Friedman]] of the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School]] and laissez-faire capitalism is analyzed from Suharto's Indonesia, 1965 and [[Chile under Pinochet|Pinochet's Chile]], 1973, among others, forward to the present. 
Current attempts at cracking the Middle East with the failed US-generated model for privatization of Iraq's economy under the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] are expanded from Klein's original Harper's Weekly  essay ''Baghdad: Year Zero.''
