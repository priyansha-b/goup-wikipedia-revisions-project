<text bytes="3926" sha1="dk7aj2u5ifc28h5h75ave512lhgxn54" xml:space="preserve">'''Naomi Klein''' (born [[1970]]) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[journalist]], [[author]] and [[Activism|activist]]. She was born in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], and now lives in [[Toronto]]. 

Klein's writing career started early, contributing to ''The Varsity'', one of the [[University of Toronto]]'s student newspapers. 

In [[2000]], just one month after protesters shut down the [[WTO Meeting of 1999]], Klein published the book ''[[No Logo]]'', which for many became a [[manifesto]] of the [[anti-globalization movement]]. The book lambastes the negative effects of brand-oriented consumer culture by describing the operations of large corporations which exist only to peddle a brand. Their products, she argues, turn people into walking billboards. These corporations are also often guilty of exploiting workers in the world's poorest countries in pursuit of ever-greater profits. Klein criticized Nike so much in the book that it became one of the first publications to receive feedback from [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]].

In [[2002]] Klein published ''[[Fences and Windows]]'', a collection of articles and speeches she'd written on behalf of the anti-globalization movement (all proceeds from the book go to benefit activist organizations through [[The Fences and Windows Fund]]). Klein also contributes to ''[[The Nation]]'', ''[[In These Times]]'', [[Canada]]'s ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', ''[[This Magazine]]'', and ''[[The Guardian]]''. 

She is also a Left Wing commie against freedom who would rather live in a left wing communist state contrary to the people who died for freedom, a freedom she enjoys in canada and writes her liberal agenda against freedom. She would rather a total left-wing socialist state free of freedoms.

Klein gave the annual [[Dalton Camp|Dalton K. Camp]] Lecture in Journalism on [[October 28]], 2004 at [[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)|St. Thomas University]] in [[Fredericton, New Brunswick]]. She also spoke at the tenth anniversary celebration of [[Stauffer Library]] at [[Queen's University]], [[Kingston, Ontario]] on [[November 4]], 2004, and at the Navigating A New World Conference on [[November 6]], along with [[Lloyd Axworthy]], [[Linda McQuaig]], [[Rom√©o Dallaire]], [[Thomas Homer-Dixon]], and [[Irshad Manji]].

Also in 2004, Klein and her husband, Canadian television journalist [[Avi Lewis]], released a [[documentary]] called ''[[The Take]]'', which profiled a group of [[layoff|laid off]] auto-parts workers in [[Argentina]] who took back control of their plant and turned it into a [[cooperative]].
