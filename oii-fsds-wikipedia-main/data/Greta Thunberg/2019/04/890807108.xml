'''Greta Ernman Thunberg''' ({{IPA-sv|²ɡreːta ²tʉːnbærj}}; born 3 January 2003) is a [[Swedes|Swedish]] political [[activism|activist]] seeking to stop [[global warming|global warming]] and climate change. In August 2018, she quickly rose to prominence for starting the first [[school strike for climate]], outside the [[Riksdag|Swedish parliament building]].&lt;ref name="Guardian1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/sep/01/swedish-15-year-old-cutting-class-to-fight-the-climate-crisis |title=The Swedish 15-year-old who's cutting class to fight the climate crisis |date=1 September 2018 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2018, she spoke at [[TED (conference)#TEDx|TEDxStockholm]], in December she addressed the [[2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference]] and in January 2019 she was invited to talk to the [[World Economic Forum]] at [[Davos]].

In December 2018, Thunberg mentioned having been diagnosed with [[Asperger syndrome]], [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD), and [[selective mutism]].&lt;ref name="Thunberg_20181212"&gt;{{cite AV media |author-first=Greta |author-last=Thunberg |author-link=Greta Thunberg &lt;!-- or |date=24 November 2018 --&gt;|date=12 December 2018 |title=School strike for climate – save the world by changing the rules |work=TEDxStockholm |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAmmUIEsN9A |access-date=29 January 2019 |time=1:46 |location=Stockholm |publisher=TED |quote=I was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrom, OCD, and selective mutism.

On 20 August 2018, Thunberg, who back then had just started ninth grade, decided to not attend school until the [[Swedish general election, 2018|2018 Sweden general election]] on 9 September after [[2018 European heat wave|heat waves]] and [[2018 Sweden wildfires|wildfires]] in Sweden.&lt;ref name="Guardian1"/&gt; Her demands were that the Swedish government reduce carbon emissions in accordance with the [[Paris Agreement]], and she protested by sitting outside the [[Riksdag]] every day during school hours with the sign ''Skolstrejk för klimatet'' (school strike for the climate).&lt;ref name="Newyorker1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-fifteen-year-old-climate-activist-who-is-demanding-a-new-kind-of-politics |title=The Fifteen-Year-Old Climate Activist Who Is Demanding a New Kind of Politics |date=2 October 2018 |newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the general elections, she continued to strike only on Fridays, gaining worldwide attention. She inspired school students across the globe to take part in student strikes.&lt;ref name="Guardian2"/&gt; As of December 2018, more than {{val|20000}} students had held strikes in at least 270 cities.&lt;ref name="Guardian2"/&gt; Thunberg credits the teen activists at [[Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School|Parkland school]] in Florida, who organized the [[March For Our Lives]], as the inspiration to begin her school climate strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Teen activist on climate change: If we don't do anything right now, we're screwed |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGmBkIUwYkA |access-date=10 February 2019 |agency=CNN |date=23 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Guardian view on teenage activists: protesters not puppets – Editorial |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/07/the-guardian-view-on-teenage-activists-look-whos-pulling-the-strings |access-date=11 February 2019 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=7 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other activism ==
Greta Thunberg participated in the Rise for Climate demonstration outside the [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]]. In October 2018, Thunberg and her family drove in an [[electric car]] to [[London]], where she addressed the 'Declaration of Rebellion' organized by [[Extinction Rebellion]] opposite the [[Houses of Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/10/31/our-darkest-hour-declaration-rebellion-new-group-vows-mass-civil-disobedience-save |title=This Is Our Darkest Hour: With Declaration of Rebellion, New Group Vows Mass Civil Disobedience to Save Planet |date=31 October 2018 |work=Common Dreams}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author-last=Rizvi |author-first=Husna |title=For climate action, ‘mass civil disobedience’ is the only way |url=https://newint.org/features/2018/11/01/climate-breakdown |access-date=15 February 2019 |work=New Internationalist |date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 November 2018, she spoke at [[TED (conference)#TEDx|TEDxStockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TEDxStockholm Theme: Wonderland |url=https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/31825 |publisher=TED |access-date=20 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author-first=Jon |author-last=Queally |title=Depressed and Then Diagnosed With Autism, Greta Thunberg Explains Why Hope Cannot Save Planet But Bold Climate Action Still Can |url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/12/19/depressed-and-then-diagnosed-autism-greta-thunberg-explains-why-hope-cannot-save |publisher=Common Dreams |access-date=20 December 2018 |date=19 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thunberg_20181212"/&gt; She spoke about realising, when she was eight years old, that [[global warming|climate change]] existed and wondering why it was not headline news on every channel, as if there was a world war going on. She said she did not go to school to become a climate scientist, as some suggested, because the science was done and only denial, ignorance and inaction was remaining. Speculating that her children and grandchildren would ask her why they had not taken action in 2018 when there was still time, she concluded with "''we can’t change the world by playing by the rules, because the rules have to be changed.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author-last=Jones |author-first=Nigel |title=Why we all need to be more like Greta |url=https://medium.com/nine-by-five-media/why-we-all-need-to-be-more-like-greta-ba36abec961 |access-date=15 February 2019 |work=Nine by Five Media |publisher=Medium |date=30 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the occasion of the [[International Women's Day]] Thunberg was proclaimed the [[Swedish Women's Educational Association#Swedish Woman of the Year|most important woman of the year in Sweden]] in 2019.
