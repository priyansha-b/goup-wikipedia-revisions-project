'''Naomi Klein''' (b. [[5 May]] [[1970]], [[Montreal, Quebec]]) is a [[Canadian]] [[journalist]], [[author]] and [[Activism|activist]] well known for her political analyses of corporate [[globalization]].

Klein ranked 11th in the [[The 2005 Global Intellectuals Poll]], a list of the world's top 100 public intellectuals compiled by ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Prospect Magazine List of Top 100 Public Intellectuals |url=http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/intellectuals/results.htm |work=Prospect Magazine |publisher=Prospect Publishing Limited |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; in conjunction with ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine. She was the highest ranked woman on the list. ''Prospect'' based the list and its rankings entirely on an Internet poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Global public intellectuals poll | url=http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=7078 |work=Prospect Magazine |publisher=Prospect Publishing Limited |year=2005 |month=November |first=David |last=Herman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/story/21099/ What Are We Fighting For?] January 27, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://workingtv.com/main3.html Democratic Rights in Wartime] Feb, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Klein was brought up in a [[Jewish]] family which has a history of activism, as does that of her husband, [[Avi Lewis]]. Her grandfather was fired for [[labour movement|labour]] organizing at [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] in the [[United States]]. Her father Michael, a physician, was a [[Vietnam War]] resister and a member of [[Physicians for Social Responsibility]]. Her mother, [[film-maker]] [[Bonnie Sherr Klein]], directed and scripted the [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography]] documentary film, ''[[Not a Love Story]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite visual|director=Bonnie Klein |producer=National Film Board of Canada |title=Not a Love Story: A Motion Picture About Pornography}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC30folder/NotLoveStory.html |title=Not a Love Story: The film and the debate |first=Lisa |last=DiCaprio |issue=30 |month=March |year=1985 |pages=39-42 |journal=Jump Cut |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her brother Seth is director of the British Columbia office of the [[Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives]]. Her in-laws are [[Michele Landsberg]] and [[Stephen Lewis]], son of [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]]. An aunt of Klein's is married to architect [[Daniel Libeskind]].

==Education==
Klein's writing career started early with contributions to ''[[The Varsity (newspaper)|The Varsity]]'', a [[University of Toronto]] student newspaper, where she served as editor-in-chief. She credits her wake-up call to [[feminism]] as the 1989 [[École Polytechnique massacre]] of female engineering students.

Klein once lectured as a Miliband Fellow at the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/miliband/visitingTeachingFellows.htm |title=Visiting teaching fellows |publisher=London School of Economics and Political Science |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein was the keynote speaker at the [[Alliance of Concerned Jewish Canadians]] (ACJC)'s first National conference.

==Career in journalism==
In 2000, Klein published the book ''[[No Logo]]'', which for many became a [[manifesto]] of the [[anti-globalization movement]]. This movement had shut down the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO Meeting of 1999]] one month before the release of ''No Logo''.{{Fact|date=June2008}} The book lambasts [[brand name|brand]]-oriented [[consumer culture]] by describing the operations of large [[corporation]]s. These corporations are also accused of being often guilty of exploiting workers in the world's poorest countries in pursuit of ever-greater profits, she writes. Klein criticized [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] so much in the book that it became one of the first publications to receive feedback from the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010618162615/http://nikebiz.com/labor/nologo_let.shtml  |archivedate=2001-06-18 |url=http://nikebiz.com/labor/nologo_let.shtml |title=Nike's response to ''No Logo'' |date=2000-03-08 |publisher=[[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''No Logo'' became an international bestseller, selling over one million copies, and translated into over 28 languages.&lt;ref name="''The Nation'' bio"&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/directory/bios/naomi_klein The Nation | Unconventional Wisdom Since 1865&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 Klein published ''Fences and Windows'', a collection of articles and speeches she had written on behalf of the anti-[[globalization]] movement (all proceeds from the book go to benefit activist organizations through The Fences and Windows Fund). Klein also contributes to ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', ''[[In These Times]]'', ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', ''[[This Magazine]]'', and ''[[The Guardian]]''.

She has continued to write on various current issues, such as the [[occupation of Iraq|war in Iraq]]. In a September 2004 article for ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' entitled "Baghdad Year Zero: Pillaging Iraq in pursuit of a [[neoconservative|neocon]] [[utopia]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harpers.org/BaghdadYearZero.html |title=Baghdad year zero: Pillaging Iraq in pursuit of a neocon utopia |year=2004 |month=September |work=Harper's Magazine |publisher=The Harper's Magazine Foundation |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; she argues that, contrary to popular belief and criticisms, the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] did have a clear plan for post-invasion Iraq, which was to build a fully unconstrained [[free market economics|free market economy]]. She describes plans to allow foreigners to extract wealth from Iraq, and the methods used to achieve those goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=04/10/13/144220 Interview] by [[Amy Goodman]] about Klein's article, "James Baker's Double Life", October 13, 2004 (video, audio &amp; print transcript)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/persuaders/interviews/klein.html PBS Frontline: The Persuaders: interview] via KQED, November 9, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 film ''[[War, Inc.]]'' was partially inspired by her article, "Baghdad Year Zero".&lt;ref&gt;[http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,2159038,00.html 'I'm basically a brand' | Interviews | guardian.co.uk Film&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2004, Klein and her husband, [[Avi Lewis]], released a [[documentary film]] called ''[[The Take (2004 film)|The Take]]'', about factory workers in  [[Argentina]] who [[recovered factory|took over the closed plant]] and resumed production, operating as a [[collective]]. The first African screening was in the Kennedy Road shack settlement in the South African city of [[Durban]] where the [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] movement began.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nplusonemag.com/klein.html "Seattle to Baghdad"] - An assessment of Klein's shift from analyzing 90's corporate culture to the War in Iraq, by Kim Phillips-Fein in [[n+1]] magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Shock Doctrine''==
Klein's third book, ''[[The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism]]'', was published on 4 September 2007, becoming an international and [[New York Times bestseller]],&lt;ref name="''The Nation'' bio"/&gt; translated into 20 languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.ca/author/results.pperl?authorid=15909 RandomHouse.ca | Author Spotlight: Naomi Klein&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The book documents the concept of [[Shock therapy (economics)|economic shock therapy]] and argues that the [[deregulated]] policies of [[free market]] [[neoliberalism]], as advocated by the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago school of economics]], have not risen to prominence because they were democratically popular, but because they were pushed through at various times when citizens were in a state of [[shock]] from a traumatic event, such as a [[natural disaster]], a [[war]], a [[coup]], or an [[economic crisis]].  Detailed in the book are case histories of [[Chile under Pinochet]], [[economy of Russia|Russia under Yeltsin]], [[economic effects of Hurricane Katrina|New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina]], and the [[privatization]] of [[economy of Iraq|Iraq's economy]] under the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]].  

''The Shock Doctrine'' was also adapted into a [[short film]] of the same name, released onto [[YouTube]]. The film was directed by Jonás Cuarón, produced and co-written by his father [[Alfonso Cuarón]]. The video has been downloaded over one million times.&lt;ref name="''The Nation'' bio"/&gt;

===Reception===

Economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] praised it in the ''[[New York Times]]'', adding, "[T]he case against these policies is even stronger than the one Klein makes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.naomiklein.org/shock-doctrine/reviews/bleakonomics|title=Bleakonomics|first=Joseph|last=Stiglitz|publisher=''New York Times''|date=[[2007-09-30]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul B. Farrell from the [[Dow Jones &amp; Company|Dow Jones Business News]] called it "one of the best economic book[s] of the 21st century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.naomiklein.org/shock-doctrine/reviews/profiting-disaster-capitalism|title=War, Terror, Catastrophe: Profiting From 'Disaster Capitalism'|first=Paul|last=Farrell|publisher=Dow Jones Business News|date=[[2007-10-16]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John N. Gray|John Gray]] wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'', "There are very few books that really help us understand the present. ''The Shock Doctrine'' is one of those books."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.naomiklein.org/shock-doctrine/reviews/end-world-we-know-it|title=The End of the World as We Know It|first=John|last=Gray|publisher=''The Guardian''|date=[[2007-09-15]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; William S. Kowinski of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' wrote, "Klein may well have revealed the master narrative of our time,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/09/23/RVGHRVRCQ.DTL Klein alleges U.S. used 'Shock' tactics to privatize public sector&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been named one of the best books of 2007 by the ''[[New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/07/books/07artb.html?ex=1197694800&amp;en=c3935c6b285e32f7&amp;ei=5099&amp;partner=TOPIXNEWS Critics' Picks - Art and Architecture Books - 2007 - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Village Voice]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/books/0749,asdf,78504,10.html/full village voice &gt; books &gt; The Best of 2007&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6496987.html PW's Best Books of the Year - 11/5/2007 - Publishers Weekly&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Observer]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,2216467,00.html That's the best thing we've read all year | Review | guardian.co.uk Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Seattle Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/books/2004068070_greatbooks16.html Books | Seattle Times book reviewers pick 2007 favorites | Seattle Times Newspaper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has received mixed reviews from [[Alexander Cockburn]] of ''[[CounterPunch]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://rmf.net/cockburn09222007.html Alexander Cockburn: On Naomi Klein's "The Shock Doctrine"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shashi Tharoor]] in the ''[[Washington Post]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/21/AR2007112101919.html Doing Well by Doing Ill - washingtonpost.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and Tom Redburn in the ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/29/books/29redb.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;oref=slogin It’s All a Grand Capitalist Conspiracy] - Tom Redburn, New York Times, September 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the book include economist [[Tyler Cowen]], who called Klein's rhetoric "ridiculous" and the book a "true economics disaster."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nysun.com/article/63867?page_no=1|title=Shock Jock|first=Tyler|last=Cowen|date=[[2007-10-03]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[London Review of Books]]'', Stephen Holmes criticized its perceived naiveté and for conflating "'free market orthodoxy' with predatory corporate behavior."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v30/n09/holm01_.html|title=Free Marketeering|first=Stephen|last=Holmes|date=[[2008-05-08]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Willman of ''[[Financial Times]]'' describes it as "a deeply flawed work that blends together disparate phenomena to create a beguiling – but ultimately dishonest – argument."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/215344fc-7b7d-11dc-8c53-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1 The profits of doom] - John Willman, Financial Times,  October 20 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Cole from ''[[The Times]]'' said it is "too easy to dismiss [''Shock Doctrine''] as a leftist rant".&lt;ref&gt;[ http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/non-fiction/article2645272.ece The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism by Naomi Klein] - Robert Cole, The Times, October 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johan Norberg]] has contested much of the book in a 20 page briefing paper,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=9384 The Klein Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Polemics]&lt;/ref&gt; and the section on Russia has been challenged by [[Anders Åslund]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Free-Market Mischief in Hot Spots of Disaster | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/10/books/10shock.html | publisher = New York Times | date = [[2007-09-10]] | accessdate = 2007-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fred Kaplan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2175133/pagenum/2/|title=Blame Yeltsin|first=Fred|last=Kaplan|publisher=Slate|date=[[2007-10-02]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
