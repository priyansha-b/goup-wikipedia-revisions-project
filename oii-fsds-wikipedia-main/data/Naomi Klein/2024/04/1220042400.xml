== Family==
Naomi Klein was born in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], into a Jewish family with a history of [[peace activism]]. Her parents were self-described [[hippie]]s&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Naomi. ''No Logo'' (2000: Vintage Canada), pp. 143–4.&lt;/ref&gt; who emigrated from the United States in 1967 as [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|war resisters to the Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="doc_townhall"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hA736oK9FPg/ |title=Video: Naomi Klein addresses the Department of Culture Town Hall |access-date=July 26, 2012 |date=September 4, 2008 |publisher=Department Of Culture |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428050703/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hA736oK9FPg%2F |archive-date=April 28, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, documentary filmmaker [[Bonnie Sherr Klein]], is best known for her [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography]] film ''[[Not a Love Story: A Film About Pornography|Not a Love Story]]''.&lt;ref name= "bonnie_sherr_klein_bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/women/002026-704-e.html |title=Biography of Bonnie Sherr Klein (*1941): Filmmaker, Author, Disability Rights Activist |publisher=Library and Archives Canada |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100401062935/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/women/002026-704-e.html |archive-date=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, Michael Klein, is a physician and a member of [[Physicians for Social Responsibility]]. Her brother, Seth Klein, is an author and the former director of the [[British Columbia]] office of the [[Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives]].

Before World War II, her paternal grandparents were communists, but they began to turn against the Soviet Union after the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] in 1939. In 1942, her grandfather, an animator at [[Disney]], was fired after [[Disney animators' strike|the 1941 strike]],&lt;ref name="tom_sito_disney"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://animationguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/PB200606.pdf|title=The Disney Strike of 1941: How It Changed Animation &amp; Comics|access-date=March 25, 2009|first=Tom| last=Sito| date=July 19, 2005| publisher= Animation World Magazine| url-status=dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141006083927/http://animationguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/PB200606.pdf|archive-date=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had to switch to working in a shipyard instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/11/naomi-klein-donald-trump-no-is-not-enough-interview| title= Naomi Klein: 'Trump is an idiot, but don't underestimate how good he is at that'|first=Tim|last=Adams|newspaper=The Observer |date=June 11, 2017|via= theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1956 they had abandoned communism. Klein's father grew up surrounded by ideas of social justice and racial equality, but found it "difficult and frightening to be the child of Communists", a so-called [[red diaper baby]].&lt;ref name="nyer" /&gt;

Klein's husband, [[Avi Lewis]], was born into a political and journalistic family. His grandfather, [[David Lewis (Canadian politician)|David Lewis]], was an architect and leader of the federal [[New Democratic Party]], while his father, [[Stephen Lewis]], was a leader of the [[Ontario New Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last= Gatehouse|first=Jonathon|date=April 12, 2016| title=Avi Lewis on the 'ideological battle' over the Leap Manifesto |url= https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/avi-lewis-on-the-ideological-battle-over-the-leap-manifesto/|access-date=December 3, 2020|website= [[Maclean's]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avi Lewis works as a TV journalist and documentary filmmaker.

==Early life and education==

Klein spent much of her teenage years in [[shopping mall]]s, obsessed with [[designer label]]s.&lt;ref name="Hand-to-Brand"/&gt; As a child and teenager, she found it "very oppressive to have a very public feminist mother," and she rejected politics, instead embracing "full-on [[consumerism]]".&lt;ref name= "Hand-to-Brand"/&gt;

She has attributed her change in worldview to two catalysts. One was when she was 17 and preparing for the [[University of Toronto]], her mother had a [[stroke]] and became severely disabled.&lt;ref name="abilities"/&gt; Naomi, her father, and her brother took care of Bonnie through the period in hospital and at home, making educational sacrifices to do so.&lt;ref name= "abilities"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.enablelink.org/include/article.php?pid=&amp;cid=&amp;subid=&amp;aid=673 |title=We are Who You are: Feminism and Disability |access-date=February 17, 2009 |first=Bonnie Sherr |last=Klein |date=Spring 1993 |publisher= | website = Enablelink.org |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011204526/http://www.enablelink.org/include/article.php?pid=&amp;cid=&amp;subid=&amp;aid=673 |archive-date=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That year off prevented her "from being such a brat".&lt;ref name="Hand-to-Brand"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.commondreams.org/views/092300-103.htm|title= Hand-To-Brand-Combat: A Profile Of Naomi Klein| access-date= February 17, 2009 |first= Katharine|last= Viner|date= September 23, 2000|newspaper= The Guardian| via=commondreams.org |url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090122050446/http://www.commondreams.org/views/092300-103.htm|archive-date= January 22, 2009|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, after she had begun her studies at the [[University of Toronto]], the second catalyst occurred: the 1989 [[École Polytechnique massacre]] of female engineering students, which proved to be a wake-up call to feminism.&lt;ref name="montreal-massacre"&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eET3COi8DPY| archive-url= https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/eET3COi8DPY| archive-date=November 17, 2021 | url-status= live|title= The Montreal Massacre |publisher= YouTube | first= Naomi | last= Klein |access-date= May 3, 2013}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein's writing career began with contributions to ''[[The Varsity (newspaper)|The Varsity]]'', a student newspaper, where she served as editor-in-chief.  After her third year at the University of Toronto, she dropped out of university to take a job at ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', followed by an editorship at ''[[This Magazine]]''. In 1995, she returned to the University of Toronto with the intention of finishing her degree&lt;ref name="nyer"&gt;{{cite magazine|url= http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/12/08/081208fa_fact_macfarquhar?currentPage=all|title= Outside Agitator: Naomi Klein and the New Left|first= Larissa |last=MacFarquhar|date= December 8, 2008|magazine= [[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but left to pursue an internship in journalism before acquiring the final credits required to complete her degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | interviewer= Brian Lamb| publisher = [[C-SPAN]]| date= November 29, 2009| url= http://www.c-span.org/video/?290173-1/qa-naomi-klein | first= Naomi | last= Klein | title= Naomi Klein Q&amp;A interview and transcript| accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

===''No Logo''===

{{Main|No Logo}}
In 1999 Klein published the book ''[[No Logo]]'', which for many became a manifesto of the [[anti-globalization movement]]. In it, she attacks brand-oriented consumer culture and the operations of large corporations. She also accuses several such corporations of unethically exploiting workers in the world's poorest countries in pursuit of greater profits. In this book, Klein criticized [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] so severely that Nike published a point-by-point response.&lt;ref name="no-logo-nike"&gt;{{cite web|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20000416175422/http://nikebiz.com/labor/nologo_let.shtml  |archive-date= April 16, 2000 |url= http://nikebiz.com/labor/nologo_let.shtml|title= Nike's response to ''No Logo''|date= March 8, 2000|publisher= [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''No Logo'' became an international bestseller, selling over one million copies in over 28 languages.&lt;ref name="Nation-bio"/&gt;

===''Fences and Windows''===

{{Main|Fences and Windows}}
Klein's ''[[Fences and Windows]]'' (2002) is a collection of her articles and speeches written on behalf of the anti-globalization movement (all proceeds from the book go to benefit activist organizations through The Fences and Windows Fund).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ereserve.library.sydney.edu.au.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au/fisher/KleinFences2002.pdf|title=Login to eResources, The University of Sydney Library|website=Ereserve.library.sydney.edu.au.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au|access-date=September 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Take''===
{{Main|The Take (2004 film)}}
''[[The Take (2004 film)|The Take]]'' (2004), a documentary film collaboration by Klein and Lewis, concerns factory workers in [[Argentina]] who took over a closed plant and resumed production, operating as a collective. The first African screening was in the Kennedy Road shack settlement in the South African city of [[Durban]], where the [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] movement began.&lt;ref name="Phillips-Fein"&gt;{{cite magazine|url= http://www.nplusonemag.com/klein.html|title= Seattle to Baghdad|access-date= February 17, 2009|first= Kim|last= Phillips-Fein|date= May 10, 2005|magazine= [[n+1]]|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080110090803/http://www.nplusonemag.com/klein.html|archive-date= January 10, 2008|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in ''[[Z Communications]]'' criticized ''The Take'' for its portrayal of the Argentine general and politician [[Juan Domingo Perón]] arguing that he was falsely portrayed as a social democrat.&lt;ref name="the_take"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://znetwork.org/znetarticle/the-take-by-daniel-morduchowicz-1|title= The Take|access-date=February 17, 2009|first= Daniel |last=Morduchowicz|date= September 20, 2004|publisher=Z Space}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Shock Doctrine''===

{{Main|The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism}}
Klein's third book, ''The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism'', was published on September 4, 2007. The book argues that the free market policies of Nobel Laureate [[Milton Friedman]] and the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School of Economics]] have risen to prominence in countries such as [[Military government of Chile (1973–1990)|Chile under Pinochet]], Poland, and [[Economy of Russia|Russia under Yeltsin]]. The book also argues that policy initiatives (for instance, the privatization of Iraq's economy under the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]]) were rushed through while the citizens of these countries were in shock from disasters, upheavals, or invasion. The book became an international and [[The New York Times bestseller|''New York Times'' bestseller]]&lt;ref name="Nation-bio"/&gt; and was translated into 28 languages.&lt;ref name="RandomHouse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.ca/author/results.pperl?authorid=15909 |title=Author Spotlight: Naomi Klein |access-date=February 17, 2009 |publisher=RandomHouse.ca |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020111515/http://www.randomhouse.ca/author/results.pperl?authorid=15909 |archive-date=October 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Naomi Klein Warsaw Nov. 19 2008 Fot Mariusz Kubik 03.jpg|thumbnail|Klein in 2008 with the Polish edition of ''Shock Doctrine'']]
Central to the book's thesis is the contention that those who wish to implement unpopular [[free market]] policies now routinely do so by taking advantage of certain features of the aftermath of major disasters, be they economic, political, military or natural. The suggestion is that when a society experiences a major 'shock' there is a widespread desire for a rapid and decisive response to correct the situation; this desire for bold and immediate action provides an opportunity for unscrupulous actors to implement policies which go far beyond a legitimate response to disaster. The book suggests that when the rush to act means the specifics of a response will go unscrutinized, that is the moment when unpopular and unrelated policies will intentionally be rushed into effect. The book appears to claim that these shocks are in some cases intentionally encouraged or even manufactured.

Klein identifies the "shock doctrine", elaborating on [[Joseph Schumpeter]], as the latest in capitalism's phases of "[[creative destruction]]".{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

''The Shock Doctrine'' was adapted into a short film of the same name, released onto [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iW1SHPgUAQ| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119013116/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iW1SHPgUAQ&amp;gl=US&amp;hl=en| archive-date=November 19, 2011 | url-status=dead|title=YouTube|website=Youtube.com|access-date=March 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original is no longer available on the site; however, a duplicate was published in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Shock Doctrine Naomi Klein and Alfonso Cuaron|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSF0e6oO_tw| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/aSF0e6oO_tw| archive-date=November 17, 2021 | url-status=live|website=YouTube|access-date=April 22, 2018}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was directed by [[Jonás Cuarón]], produced and co-written by his father [[Alfonso Cuarón]].

The publication of ''The Shock Doctrine'' increased Klein's prominence, with ''[[The New Yorker]]'' judging her "the most visible and influential figure on the American left—what [[Howard Zinn]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] were thirty years ago." On February 24, 2009, the book was awarded the inaugural [[Warwick Prize for Writing]] from the [[University of Warwick]] in England.&lt;ref name="Warwick Prize Press Release"&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |title=Naomi Klein's The Shock Doctrine wins first Warwick Prize for Writing |url=https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/naomi_kleins_the/ |date=25 February 2009 |access-date=2024-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize carried a cash award of £50,000.

===''Doppelganger: a Trip into the Mirror World''===
{{Main|Doppelganger (Klein book)}}
Released in September 2023, ''[[Doppelganger (Klein book)|Doppelganger]]'' is a memoir and social critique that contrasts Klein's worldview with [[Naomi Wolf]]'s, a writer who is often mistaken for Klein and vice versa. In her 10-page introduction, Klein explains how she has been mistaken for the "other Naomi", with whom she "has been chronically confused for over a decade... I have been confused with Other Naomi for so long and so frequently that I have often felt that she was following me". For this reason, she started to follow what she calls Wolf's "new alliances with some of the most dangerous men on the planet", and wrote the book with the intention of using her [[doppelganger]] experience "as a guide into and through what I have come to understand as our doppelganger culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Klein | first=Naomi | title=Doppelganger: A Trip Into the Mirror World | publisher=[[Penguin Random House UK]] | year=2023 | isbn=978-0-241-62131-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J6vvzwEACAAJ | access-date=26 October 2023 | page=4,10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein suggests that the Western world has fractured along political and ideological lines to such an extent that each side feels the other exists in a "mirror world".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Goldberg |first=Michelle |date=September 4, 2023 |title= Naomi Klein, Naomi Wolf and the Political Upside Down |language=en-US |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/04/opinion/columnists/naomi-klein-wolf-doppelganger.html |access-date=September 5, 2023 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book received primarily positive reviews and debuted at #8 on the New York Times hardcover nonfiction weekly best seller list.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Hardcover Nonfiction Books – Best Sellers – Books – The New York Times |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/hardcover-nonfiction/ |access-date=September 21, 2023 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iraq War criticism ===
Klein has written about the [[Iraq War]]. In "Baghdad Year Zero" (''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', September 2004),&lt;ref name="Harpers"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.harpers.org/BaghdadYearZero.html|title= Baghdad year zero: Pillaging Iraq in pursuit of a neocon utopia|first= Naomi |last=Klein| date= September 2004| work= [[Harper's Magazine]]|publisher= The Harper's Magazine Foundation|access-date= September 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klein argues that, contrary to popular belief, the [[George W.

Klein's "Bring Najaf to New York" (''The Nation'', August 2004) argued that [[Muqtada Al Sadr]]'s [[Mahdi Army]] "represents the overwhelmingly mainstream sentiment in Iraq" and that, if he were elected, "Sadr would try to turn Iraq into a [[theocracy]] like Iran," although his immediate demands were for "direct elections and an end to foreign occupation".&lt;ref name="Najif-Nation"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.thenation.com/article/bring-najaf-new-york/ |title=Bring Najaf to New York |access-date=August 12, 2017 |first=Naomi |last=Klein |date= August 26, 2004 |work=[[The Nation]] |archive-date=August 12, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812220445/https://www.thenation.com/article/bring-najaf-new-york/ |url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism of Israel ===
In March 2008, Klein was the keynote speaker at the first national conference of the [[Independent Jewish Voices (Canada)|Alliance of Concerned Jewish Canadians]].  In January 2009, during the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]], Klein supported the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] (BDS) campaign against [[Israel]], arguing that "the best strategy to end the increasingly bloody occupation is for Israel to become the target of the kind of global movement that put an end to apartheid in South Africa."&lt;ref name= "time-for-boycott"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jan/10/naomi-klein-boycott-israel|title= Enough.

In summer 2009, on the occasion of the publication of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] translation of her book ''The Shock Doctrine'', Klein visited Israel, the [[West Bank]], and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]], combining the promotion of her book and the BDS campaign. In an interview to the Israeli newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'', she emphasized that it was important "not to boycott Israelis but rather to boycott the normalization of Israel and the conflict."&lt;ref name="klein_haaretz"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.haaretz.com/news/naomi-klein-oppose-the-state-not-the-people-1.279194|title= Naomi Klein: Oppose the State, Not the People| access-date=March 22, 2016| first= Yotam |last=Feldman|date= July 1, 2009| work= [[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech in [[Ramallah]] on June 27, she apologized to [[Palestinians]] for not joining the BDS campaign earlier.&lt;ref name="klein_ramallah"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://thefastertimes.com/Palestine/2009/07/07/naomi-klein-in-ramallah-i-am-ashamed-that-it-took-me-this-long-to-endorse-the-call-to-boycott-israel…it-was-nothing-but-cowardice/|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090713024624/http://thefastertimes.com/Palestine/2009/07/07/naomi-klein-in-ramallah-i-am-ashamed-that-it-took-me-this-long-to-endorse-the-call-to-boycott-israel%E2%80%A6it-was-nothing-but-cowardice/| url-status= dead |archive-date= July 13, 2009|title= Naomi Klein in Ramallah: I am ashamed that it took me this long|access-date= July 13, 2009|first= Naomi|last= Klein| date= July 7, 2009|publisher= | website= The Faster Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her remarks, particularly that "[some Jews] even think we get one get-away-with-genocide-free card" were characterized by Noam Schimmel, an op-ed columnist in ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', as "violent" and "unethical", and as the "most perverse of aspersions on Jews, an age-old stereotype of Jews as intrinsically evil and malicious."&lt;ref name="schimmel"&gt;{{cite news| title= 'The Jews' get-away-with-genocide-free-card'|newspaper= [[Jerusalem Post]]| first= Noam |last=Schimmel |url= http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/The-Jews-get-away-with-genocide-free-card |date= July 18, 2009 |access-date=August 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein was also a spokesperson for the protest against the [[2009 Toronto International Film Festival#Controversy over Tel Aviv spotlight|spotlight on Tel Aviv]] at the [[2009 Toronto International Film Festival]], a spotlight that Klein said was a very selective and misleading portrait of Israel.&lt;ref name= "globe_and_mail"&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/we-dont-feel-like-celebrating-with-israel-this-year/article1278582/| title= We don't feel like celebrating with Israel this year.| first= Naomi |last=Klein|newspaper= The Globe and Mail |date= September 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has also served on the advisory board of the organization [[Jewish Voice for Peace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last= |date=2023-04-29 |title=Jewish Voice for Peace |url= https://promisedlandmuseum.org/jewish-voice-for-peace/ |access-date= 2023-11-23 |website= promisedlandmuseum.org| publisher = Promised Land Museum |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Naomi Klein on Israel's 'Doppelganger Politics' |url=https://jewishcurrents.org/naomi-klein-on-israels-doppelganger-politics |access-date=2023-11-23 |website= Jewish Currents |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2023, in the context of the [[2023 Israel–Hamas war]], she wrote:
{{cquote|For [[Zionism|Zionist believers]] (I'm not one of them), [[Jew hatred]] is the central rationale for why Israel must exist as a [[Nuclear-armed country|nuclear-armed fortress]]. Within this worldview, [[antisemitism]] is cast as a primordial force that cannot be weakened or confronted. The world will always turn away from us in our hour of need, Zionism tells us, just as it did during the [[Holocaust]], which is why force alone is presented as the only conceivable response to any and all threats. The Israeli state's current murderous leveling of Gaza is the latest, unspeakably horrific manifestation of this ideology, and there will be more in the coming days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | archiveurl= https://archive.today/20231011230959/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/11/why-are-some-of-the-left-celebrating-the-killings-of-israeli-jews#selection-1301.0-1301.15 | archivedate= October 11, 2023| title = In Gaza and Israel, side with the child over the gun].

=== Environmentalism ===

{{rquote|right|Indeed the three policy pillars of the neoliberal age—privatization of the public sphere, deregulation of the corporate sector, and the lowering of income and corporate taxes, paid for with cuts to public spending—are each incompatible with many of the actions we must take to bring our emissions to safe levels.

By 2009, Klein's attention had turned to environmentalism, with particular focus on [[climate change]], the subject of her book ''[[This Changes Everything (book)|This Changes Everything]]'' (2014).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2011/3/9/my_fear_is_that_climate_change "'My Fear is that Climate Change is the Biggest Crisis of All': Naomi Klein Warns Global Warming Could Be Exploited by Capitalism and Militarism"], ''Democracy Now!'', March 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; According to her website in 2016, the book and its accompanying film (released in 2015) would be about "how the [[climate crisis]] can spur economic and political transformation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.naomiklein.org/meet-naomi | title= Meet Naomi | website= naomiklein.org| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160815071747/http://www.naomiklein.org/meet-naomi |archivedate=August 15, 2016| publisher= Naomi Klein | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview by Graeme Greene in ''[[New Internationalist]]'', Klein rejected criticism that ''This Changes Everything'' politicized the climate issue and that the issue should be apolitical, asserting that such criticism reflected "how blind so many within the mainstream climate discussion are to the fact that they themselves are fully immersed within the confines of neoliberalism; ... It's a fantasy that you could fundamentally shift the building blocks of your economy without engaging with politics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Rocking the Boat | last1 = Greene | first1 = Graeme | last2 = Klein | first2 = Naomi | magazine = [[New Internationalist]] | date = November 2014 | pages = 38–39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the wake of [[Hurricane Sandy]], she warned that the climate crisis constitutes a massive opportunity for disaster capitalists and corporations seeking to profit from crisis. But equally, the climate crisis "can be a historic moment to usher in the next great wave of progressive change," or a so-called "People's Shock."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/superstorm-sandy-peoples-shock/ | title = Superstorm Sandy – a People's Shock? | last = Klein | first = Naomi | date = November 5, 2012 | magazine = The Nation | access-date = August 16, 2022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2022, Klein published an article on ''[[The Intercept]]'' regarding [[2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP27]] and the repression of the Egyptian government;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Klein |first=Naomi |date=October 7, 2022 |title=Holding the COP27 Summit in Egypt's Police State Creates a Moral Crisis for the Climate Movement |url=https://theintercept.com/2022/10/07/egypt-cop27-climate-prisoners-alaa/ |access-date=July 22, 2023 |website= The Intercept |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; the conference took place in Egypt, a country widely seen as repressive and autocratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date= September 30, 2022 |title=COP27: Egypt pressed to make human rights move before climate summit |language=en-GB |work= BBC.com |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-63086209 |access-date=July 22, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; She goes on to state "[[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi|Sisi's]] Egypt is making a big show of solar panels and biodegradable straws ... but in reality, the regime imprisons activists and bans research. The climate movement should not play along." calling it 'greenwashing'.{{citation needed|date=October 2023}} In an interview with ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', she says “what is not welcome would be pointing out this enormous lucrative network of deals that the military itself is engaged in that are linked to fossil fuels, that are linked to destroying remaining green space in cities like Cairo”. Klein also stressed the release of prominent political prisoner and activist [[Alaa Abd El-Fattah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Egypt's Carceral Climate Summit: Naomi Klein on the Crisis of COP27 Being Held in a Police State |url=https://www.democracynow.org/2022/10/21/naomi_klein_cop27_un_egypt_greenwashing |access-date=July 22, 2023 |website=Democracy Now! |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein was a key instigator of the [[Leap Manifesto]], a political manifesto issued in the context of the [[2015 Canadian federal election]] focused on addressing the climate crisis through restructuring the Canadian economy and dealing with issues of income and wealth inequality, racism, and colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Chen|first=Michael|date=September 15, 2015|title='Leap manifesto' backed by prominent NDPers, actors, activists calls for upending of capitalist system|work=The Globe and Mail|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/manifesto-backed-by-notable-ndpers-contrasts-party-platform-with-call-for-radical-economic-change/article26364933/|access-date=December 3, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manifesto has been noted as an influence in the development of the [[Green New Deal]] and eventually led to the establishment of The Leap, an organization that works to promote the realization of the principles behind the original manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lukacs|first=Martin|title=The Trudeau Formula: Seduction and Betrayal in an Age of Discontent.|publisher=Black Rose Books|year=2019|isbn=9781551647487|location=Montreal|pages=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gobby|first=Jen|title=More Powerful Together: Conversations with Climate Activists and Indigenous Land Defenders|publisher=Fernwood Press|year=2020|isbn=9781773632261|location=Winnipeg|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2019, along with other public figures, Klein signed a letter supporting [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] describing him as "a beacon of hope in the struggle against emergent far-right nationalism, xenophobia and racism in much of the democratic world" and endorsed him in the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 UK general election]].&lt;ref name="nme"&gt;{{cite news |last=Neale|first=Matthew|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/new-letter-supporting-jeremy-corbyn-2568734|title=Exclusive: New letter supporting Jeremy Corbyn signed by Roger Waters, Robert Del Naja and more |work=[[NME]]|date=November 16, 2019|access-date=November 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
