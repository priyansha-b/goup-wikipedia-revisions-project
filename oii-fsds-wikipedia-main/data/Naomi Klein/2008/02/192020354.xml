'''Naomi Klein''' (b. [[5 May]] [[1970]], [[Montreal, Quebec]]) is a [[Canadian]] [[journalist]], [[author]] and [[Activism|activist]] well known for her political analyses of corporate [[globalization]].

Klein ranked 11th in the [[The 2005 Global Intellectuals Poll]], a list of the world's top 100 public intellectuals compiled by ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Prospect Magazine List of Top 100 Public Intellectuals |url=http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/intellectuals/results.htm |work=Prospect Magazine |publisher=Prospect Publishing Limited |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; in conjunction with ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine. She was the highest ranked woman on the list. ''Prospect'' based the list and its rankings entirely on an Internet poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Global public intellectuals poll | url=http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=7078 |work=Prospect Magazine |publisher=Prospect Publishing Limited |year=2005 |month=November |first=David |last=Herman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/story/21099/ What Are We Fighting For?] January 27, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://workingtv.com/main3.html Democratic Rights in Wartime] Feb, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family of origin==
Klein's family has a history of activism, as does that of her husband, [[Avi Lewis]]. Her grandfather was fired for [[labour movement|labour]] organizing at [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] in the [[United States]]. Her father Michael, a physician, was a [[Vietnam War]] resister and a member of [[Physicians for Social Responsibility]]. Her mother, [[film-maker]] [[Bonnie Sherr Klein]], directed and scripted the [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography]] documentary film, ''[[Not a Love Story]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite visual|director=Bonnie Klein |producer=National Film Board of Canada |title=Not a Love Story: A Motion Picture About Pornography}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC30folder/NotLoveStory.html |title=Not a Love Story: The film and the debate |first=Lisa |last=DiCaprio |issue=30 |month=March |year=1985 |pages=39-42 |journal=Jump Cut |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her brother Seth is director of the British Columbia office of the [[Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives]]. Her in-laws are [[Michele Landsberg]] and [[Stephen  Lewis]], son of [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]]. An aunt of Klein's is married to architect [[Daniel Libeskind]].

==Education==
Klein's writing career started early with contributions to ''[[The Varsity (newspaper)|The Varsity]]'', a [[University of Toronto]] student newspaper, where she served as editor-in-chief. She credits her wake-up call to [[feminism]] as the 1989 [[École Polytechnique massacre]] of female engineering students.

Klein once lectured as a Miliband Fellow at the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/miliband/visitingTeachingFellows.htm |title=Visiting teaching fellows |publisher=London School of Economics and Political Science |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in journalism==
In 2000, Klein published the book ''[[No Logo]]'', which for many became a [[manifesto]] of the [[anti-globalization movement]]. This movement had shut down the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO Meeting of 1999]] one month before the release of ''No Logo''. The book lambasts [[brand name|brand]]-oriented [[consumer culture]] by describing the operations of large [[corporation]]s. These corporations are also accused of being often guilty of exploiting workers in the world's poorest countries in pursuit of ever-greater profits, she writes. Klein criticized [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] so much in the book that it became one of the first publications to receive feedback from the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010618162615/http://nikebiz.com/labor/nologo_let.shtml  |archivedate=2001-06-18 |url=http://nikebiz.com/labor/nologo_let.shtml |title=Nike's response to ''No Logo'' |date=2000-03-08 |publisher=[[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 Klein published ''Fences and Windows'', a collection of articles and speeches she had written on behalf of the anti-[[globalization]] movement (all proceeds from the book go to benefit activist organizations through The Fences and Windows Fund). Klein also contributes to ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', ''[[In These Times]]'', ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', ''[[This Magazine]]'', and ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20021113145543/http://economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=1429429 "Why Naomi Klein needs to grow up"], ''[[The Economist]]'', November 7, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thismagazine.ca/issues/2002/11/rebelsell.php "The Rebel Sell:  If we all hate consumerism, how come we can't stop shopping? "], Nov. 11, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

She has continued to write on various current issues, such as the [[occupation of Iraq|war in Iraq]]. In a September 2004 article for ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' entitled "Baghdad Year Zero: Pillaging Iraq in pursuit of a [[neoconservative|neocon]] [[utopia]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harpers.org/BaghdadYearZero.html |title=Baghdad year zero: Pillaging Iraq in pursuit of a neocon utopia |year=2004 |month=September |work=Harper's Magazine |publisher=The Harper's Magazine Foundation |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; she argues that, contrary to popular belief and criticisms, the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] did have a clear plan for post-invasion Iraq, which was to build a fully unconstrained [[free market economics|free market economy]]. She describes plans to allow foreigners to extract wealth from Iraq, and the methods used to achieve those goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=04/10/13/144220 Interview] by [[Amy Goodman]] about Klein's article, "James Baker's Double Life", October 13, 2004 (video, audio &amp; print transcript)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/persuaders/interviews/klein.html PBS Frontline: The Persuaders: interview] via KQED, Nov. 9, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2004, Klein and her husband, [[Avi Lewis]], released a [[documentary film]] called ''[[The Take]]'', about factory workers in  [[Argentina]] who took over the closed plant and resumed production, operating as a [[collective]]. The first African screening was in the Kennedy Road shack settlement in the South African city of [[Durban]] where the [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] movement began.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nplusonemag.com/klein.html "Seattle to Baghdad"] - An assessment of Klein's shift from analyzing 90's corporate culture to the War in Iraq, by Kim Phillips-Fein in [[n+1]] magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

She has been accused of being "ignorant," especially on Youtube.

==''The Shock Doctrine''==
Klein's third book, ''[[The Shock Doctrine]]: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism'', was published on 4 September 2007. It has been favorably reviewed by the [[Dow Jones Business News]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.naomiklein.org/shock-doctrine/reviews/profiting-disaster-capitalism|title=War, Terror, Catastrophe: Profiting From 'Disaster Capitalism'|first=Paul|last=Farrell|publisher=Dow Jones Business News|date=[[2007-10-16]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;, by [[Joseph Stiglitz]] in ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.naomiklein.org/shock-doctrine/reviews/bleakonomics|title=Bleakonomics|first=Joseph|last=Stiglitz|publisher=''New York Times''|date=[[2007-09-30]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and by [[John Gray]] in ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.naomiklein.org/shock-doctrine/reviews/end-world-we-know-it|title=The End of the World as We Know It|first=John|last=Gray|publisher=''The Guardian''|date=[[2007-09-15]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Critics of ''The Shock Doctrine'' include:
*The economist [[Tyler Cowen]]. Writing in the [[New York Sun]]'', he called Klein's rhetoric "ridiculous,"  also saying that the ''The Shock Doctrine'' is a "true economics disaster." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nysun.com/article/63867?page_no=1|title=Shock Jock|first=Tyler|last=Cowen|date=[[2007-10-03]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Andrew Potter]] and [[Joseph Heath]], in their book ''[[The Rebel Sell]]''.
