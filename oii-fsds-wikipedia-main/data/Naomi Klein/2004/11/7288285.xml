Klein wrote the book ''[[No Logo]]'' ([[2000]]), which became a [[manifesto]] of the [[anti-globalization movement]].  She has also written ''[[Fences and Windows]]'' ([[2002]]) and contributes to ''[[The Nation]]'', ''[[In These Times]]'', [[Canada]]'s ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', and ''[[The Guardian]]'' in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].

''No Logo'' is her best-known work, where she lambasts the negative effects of brand-oriented consumer culture. What makes No Logo especially notable was that it was written before the 'anti-globalization' movement became well known on any level. She describes the operations of large corporations which exist only to peddle a brand. Their products, she argues, turn people into walking billboards. On a more subtle note, these corporations are often guilty of exploiting workers in the world's poorest countries in pursuit of ever-greater profits. Klein criticized Nike so much in the book that it became one of the first publications to receive feedback from [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]].

Since No Logo, she has continued to write on various emerging issues, such as the invasion of [[Iraq]]. In a September 2004 article for [[Harper's Magazine]] entitled "''Pillaging Iraq in pursuit of a neocon utopia''", she argues that, contrary to popular belief and criticisms, the Bush Administration did have a clear plan for post-invasion Iraq, which was to build a fully unconstrained free market [[economy]]. She describes plans to allow foreigners to extract wealth from Iraq, and the methods used to achieve those goals.

Her writing career started early, contributing the Varsity, one of the [[University of Toronto]]'s student newspapers. Klein is married to Canadian television journalist [[Avi Lewis]].

Klein spoke at The 3rd annual [[Dalton Camp|Dalton K. Camp]] Lecture in Journalism on [[October 28]], 2004 at [[Saint Thomas University]] in [[Fredericton, New Brunswick]]. She also spoke at the 10th Anniversary celebration of [[Stauffer Library]] at [[Queen's University]], [[Kingston, Ontario]] on November 4, 2004 and the Navigating A New World Conference hosted by [[Random House]] of Canada along with [[Llyod Axworthy]], [[Linda McQuaig]], [[Rom√©o Dallaire]], [[Thomas Homer-Dixon]], and [[Irshad Manji]] on [[November 6]], 2004 at the [[University of Toronto]] in [[Toronto, Ontario]].
