'''Greta Ernman Thunberg''' ({{IPA-sv|²ɡreːta ²tʉːnbærj|lang|Greta Thunberg says own name.ogg}}; born January 3, 2003) is a Swedish [[climate activist]] who has been described as a role model for worldwide student activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acrimonia.it/en/2019/03/wmn-role-models-greta-thunberg/ |title=WMN role models: Greta Thunberg |author-last=Nava |author-first=Alessandra |date=18 March 2019 |website=Acrimònia |access-date=9 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.insidescandinavianbusiness.com/article.php?id=371 |title=Greta Thunberg Wins German Award |author-last=Lindgren |author-first=Emma |date=2 April 2019 |website=Inside Scandinavian Business |access-date=9 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is known for having initiated the [[school strike for climate]] movement that formed in November 2018 and surged globally after the [[COP24]] conference in December the same year. Her personal activism began in August 2018, when her recurring and solitary ''Skolstrejk för klimatet'' ("School strike for the climate") protesting outside the [[Swedish parliament]] in Stockholm began attracting media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/wedonthavetime/this-15-year-old-girl-breaks-swedish-law-for-the-climate-d1a48ab97e3a |title=This 15-year-old Girl Breaks Swedish Law for the Climate |author-last=Olsson |author-first=David |date=23 August 2018 |website=Medium |access-date=26 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 15, 2019, an estimated number of 1.4 million students in 112 countries around the world joined her call in the striking and protesting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://harvardpolitics.com/united-states/youth-demand-climate-action-in-global-school-strike/ |title=Youth Demand Climate Action in Global School Strike |author-last1=Cohen |author-first1=Ilana |author-last2=Heberle |author-first2=Jacob |date=19 March 2019 |website=Harvard Political Review |access-date=22 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next major climate strike to take place globally is scheduled on May 24, 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://peoplesdispatch.org/2019/03/16/over-1-million-students-across-the-world-join-global-climate-strike/ |title=Over 1 million students across the world join Global Climate Strike |author-last=Shabeer |author-first=Muhammed |date=16 March 2019 |newspaper=Peoples Dispatch |access-date=22 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 13, 2019, three members of the [[Storting|Norwegian parliament]] nominated Thunberg as a candidate for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] later this year. Thunberg responded that she was "honoured and very grateful" for the nomination.&lt;ref name="av01"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/climate-activist-greta-thunberg-nobel-peace-prize_n_5c8a4ab8e4b0fbd7662145a4|title=16-Year-Old Climate Activist Greta Thunberg Nominated For Nobel Peace Prize |author-last=Vaglanos |author-first=Alanna |date=14 March 2019 |newspaper=[[Huffington Post]] |access-date=22 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunberg has already received various prizes and awards for her activism.

At a [[TED (conference)#TEDx|TEDx]] talk in November 2018, Thunberg said she first heard about climate change at the age of eight, but couldn't understand why so little was being done about it.&lt;ref name="Thunberg_20181212"&gt;{{cite AV media |author-first=Greta |author-last=Thunberg |date=12 December 2018 |title=School strike for climate – save the world by changing the rules |work=TEDxStockholm |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAmmUIEsN9A |access-date=29 January 2019 |time=1:46 |location=Stockholm |publisher=TED |quote=I was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrom, OCD, and selective mutism.

Later on she was diagnosed with [[Asperger syndrome]], [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD), and [[selective mutism]]. She added that selective mutism meant she was speaking only when she needed to and that "now is one of those moments"; and that being on the "spectrum" was an advantage "as almost everything is black or white".&lt;ref name="Thunberg_20181212"/&gt;

Thunberg has said: "I feel like I am dying inside if I don't protest". Her father doesn't like her cutting class but says: "[We] respect that she wants to make a stand. She can either sit at home and be really unhappy, or protest and be happy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Swedish 15-year-old who's cutting class to fight the climate crisis |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=1 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To lower her family's [[carbon footprint]], she insisted they become [[Veganism|vegan]] and [[give up flying]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/climate-crusading-schoolgirl-greta-thunberg-pleads-next-generations-case |title=Climate crusading schoolgirl Greta Thunberg pleads next generation's case |date=5 December 2018 |website=[[The Straits Times]] |access-date=22 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as she did herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.repubblica.it/dossier/ambiente/proteste-clima/2019/03/11/news/greta_thunberg_la_paladina_del_clima_mamma_non_vuole_ma_salvero_il_pianeta_-221266090/ |title=Greta Thunberg, la paladina del clima: "Mamma non vuole ma salverò il pianeta" |date=11 March 2019 |website=[[Repubblica.it]] |language=it |access-date=19 April 2019 |quote=Ho smesso di usare l'aereo, ho smesso di mangiare carne e latticini}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 20, 2018, Thunberg, who had just started ninth grade, decided to not attend school until the [[Swedish general election, 2018|2018 Sweden general election]] on September 9 after [[2018 European heat wave|heat waves]] and [[2018 Sweden wildfires|wildfires]] in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/sep/01/swedish-15-year-old-cutting-class-to-fight-the-climate-crisis |title=The Swedish 15-year-old who's cutting class to fight the climate crisis |date=1 September 2018 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her demands were that the Swedish government reduce carbon emissions in accordance with the [[Paris Agreement]], and she protested by sitting outside the [[Riksdag]] every day during school hours with the sign ''Skolstrejk för klimatet'' (school strike for the climate).&lt;ref name="Newyorker1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-fifteen-year-old-climate-activist-who-is-demanding-a-new-kind-of-politics |title=The Fifteen-Year-Old Climate Activist Who Is Demanding a New Kind of Politics |date=2 October 2018 |newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the general elections, she continued to strike only on Fridays, gaining worldwide attention. She inspired school students across the globe to take part in student strikes.&lt;ref name="Guardian2"/&gt; As of December 2018, more than 20,000 students had held strikes in at least 270 cities.&lt;ref name="Guardian2"/&gt; Thunberg credits the teen activists at [[Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School]] in [[Parkland, Florida]], who organized the [[March For Our Lives]], as the inspiration to begin her school climate strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Teen activist on climate change: If we don't do anything right now, we're screwed |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGmBkIUwYkA |access-date=10 February 2019 |agency=[[CNN]] |date=23 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Guardian view on teenage activists: protesters not puppets – Editorial |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/07/the-guardian-view-on-teenage-activists-look-whos-pulling-the-strings |access-date=11 February 2019 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=7 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From October 2018 onwards, Thunberg's activism evolved from solitary protesting to taking part in demonstrations throughout Europe; making several high profile public speeches; and mobilising her growing number of followers on [[social media]] platforms. However, by March 2019 she still stages her regular protests outside the Swedish parliament every Friday, where other students now occasionally join her. Her activism has not interfered with her schoolwork, but she has had less spare time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/11/greta-thunberg-schoolgirl-climate-change-warrior-some-people-can-let-things-go-i-cant |title=Greta Thunberg, schoolgirl climate change warrior: 'Some people can let things go.

[[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN General Secretary]] [[António Guterres]] has endorsed the school strikes initiated by Thunberg, admitting that "My generation has failed to respond properly to the dramatic challenge of climate change. This is deeply felt by young people. No wonder they are angry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/15/climate-strikers-urgency-un-summit-world-leaders |title=The climate strikers should inspire us all to act at the next UN summit |date=15 March 2019 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=18 March 2019 |author-link=António Guterres |author-first=António |author-last=Guterres}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greta Thunberg participated in the Rise for Climate demonstration outside the [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]]. In [[London]] in October 2018, she addressed the 'Declaration of Rebellion' organized by [[Extinction Rebellion]] opposite the [[Houses of Parliament]]. She said: ''"We're facing an immediate unprecedented crisis that has never been treated as a crisis and our leaders are all acting like children. We need to wake up and change everything"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/10/31/our-darkest-hour-declaration-rebellion-new-group-vows-mass-civil-disobedience-save |title=This Is Our Darkest Hour: With Declaration of Rebellion, New Group Vows Mass Civil Disobedience to Save Planet |date=31 October 2018 |work=Common Dreams}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author-last=Rizvi |author-first=Husna |title=For climate action, ‘mass civil disobedience’ is the only way |url=https://newint.org/features/2018/11/01/climate-breakdown |access-date=15 February 2019 |work=New Internationalist |date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 24, 2018, she spoke at TEDxStockholm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TEDxStockholm Theme: Wonderland |url=https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/31825 |publisher=TED |access-date=20 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author-first=Jon |author-last=Queally |title=Depressed and Then Diagnosed With Autism, Greta Thunberg Explains Why Hope Cannot Save Planet But Bold Climate Action Still Can |url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/12/19/depressed-and-then-diagnosed-autism-greta-thunberg-explains-why-hope-cannot-save |publisher=Common Dreams |access-date=20 December 2018 |date=19 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thunberg_20181212"/&gt; She spoke about realizing, when she was eight years old, that [[global warming|climate change]] existed and wondering why it was not headline news on every channel, as if there was a world war going on. She said she did not go to school to become a climate scientist, as some suggested, because the science was done and only denial, ignorance and inaction remained. Speculating that her children and grandchildren would ask her why they had not taken action in 2018 when there was still time, she concluded with ''"we can’t change the world by playing by the rules, because the rules have to be changed."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author-last=Jones |author-first=Nigel |title=Why we all need to be more like Greta |url=https://medium.com/nine-by-five-media/why-we-all-need-to-be-more-like-greta-ba36abec961 |access-date=15 February 2019 |work=Nine by Five Media |publisher=Medium |date=30 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the week, she warned the global leaders that ''"I don't want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day. And then I want you to act. I want you to act as you would in a crisis. I want you to act as if the house was on fire - because it is"''.&lt;ref&gt; I want you to panic: 16-year-old issues climate warning at Davos - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=160&amp;v=RjsLm5PCdVQ Greta on Youtube].&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote in an article for [[The Guardian]] in January 2019: ''"According to the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), we are less than 12 years away from not being able to undo our mistakes. In that time, unprecedented changes in all aspects of society need to have taken place, including a reduction of our [[carbon dioxide|{{CO2}}]] emissions by at least 50%".'' &lt;ref name="Our house is on fire"&gt;{{cite news |last=Thunberg|first=Greta|title='Our house is on fire': Greta Thunberg, 16, urges leaders to act on climate|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/25/our-house-is-on-fire-greta-thunberg16-urges-leaders-to-act-on-climate |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=25 January 2019|access-date=14 February 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 21, 2019, she spoke at a conference of the [[European Economic and Social Committee]] and to [[European Commission]] chief [[Jean-Claude Juncker]], where she said that to limit global warming to less than the two degrees C goal established at the [[Paris climate accord]], the [[EU]] must reduce their [[carbon dioxide|{{CO2}}]] emissions by 80% by 2030, double the 40% goal set in Paris. ''"If we fail to do so" she said, "all that will remain of our political leaders' legacy will be the greatest failure of human history."'' Later, she joined 7,500 Belgian student in a climate protest in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author-last=Carmichael |author-first=Lachlan |title=Climate activist Thunberg urges EU to double carbon reduction targets |url=https://news.yahoo.com/climate-activist-thunberg-urges-eu-double-carbon-reduction-111042030.html |access-date=22 February 2019 |work=news.yahoo.com |date=21 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Swedish teen leads Belgian students on 7th climate march |work=[[Miami Herald]]|agency=[[The Associated Press]] |date=21 February 2019 |url=https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/article226559019.html |access-date=22 February 2019 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190222204457/https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/article226559019.html |archive-date=22 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At an April 2019 meeting at the [[European Parliament]] in Strasbourg with MEP's and EU officials, she chided those present ''"for three emergency Brexit summits and no emergency summit regarding the breakdown of the climate and the environment"''. Climate change discussions have not been dominant at EU summits because other issues have taken precedence.&lt;ref name="Rankin"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rankin|first=Jennifer|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/16/greta-thunberg-urges-eu-leaders-wake-up-climate-change-school-strike-movement|title=Forget Brexit and focus on climate change, Greta Thunberg tells EU|work=The Guardian|date=16 April 2019|access-date=24 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued: ''"The extinction rate is up to 10,000 times faster than what is considered normal, with up to 200 species becoming extinct every single day".'' In addition, the ''"[e]rosion of fertile topsoil, deforestation of the rainforest, toxic air pollution, loss of insects and wildlife, acidification of our oceans ... are all disastrous trends."'' Thunberg was given a 30-second standing ovation at the end of her speech.&lt;ref name="Rankin" /&gt;

On the occasion of the [[International Women's Day]] Thunberg was proclaimed the [[Swedish Woman of the Year|most important woman of the year in Sweden]] in 2019. The award was based on a survey by the institute ''Inizio'' on behalf of the newspaper ''[[Aftonbladet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Schulstreik fürs Klima – Klimaaktivistin Greta Thunberg in Schweden "Frau des Jahres"|language=de |author=dpa |journal=[[Zeit Online]] |date=8 March 2019 |url=https://www.zeit.de/news/2019-03/08/klimaaktivistin-greta-thunberg-in-schweden-frau-des-jahres-190308-99-297313 |access-date=8 March 2019 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190309164608/https://www.zeit.de/news/2019-03/08/klimaaktivistin-greta-thunberg-in-schweden-frau-des-jahres-190308-99-297313 |archive-date=8 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 31, 2019, she received the German [[Goldene Kamera]] Special Climate Protection award.&lt;ref name="Goldene Kamera"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Greta Thunberg wird mit der GOLDENEN KAMERA 2019 ausgezeichnet |trans-title=Greta Thunberg is awarded the GOLDEN CAMERA 2019 |publisher=[[Goldene Kamera]] |date=18 March 2019 |language=de |url=https://www.goldenekamera.de/preisverleihung/nominierte-preistraeger-2019/article216694793/Greta-Thunberg-wird-mit-der-GOLDENEN-KAMERA-2019-ausgezeichnet.html |access-date=31 March 2019 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331123607/https://www.goldenekamera.de/preisverleihung/nominierte-preistraeger-2019/article216694793/Greta-Thunberg-wird-mit-der-GOLDENEN-KAMERA-2019-ausgezeichnet.html |archive-date=31 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Verleihung der Goldenen Kamera Erst Klimaaktivistin geehrt, dann SUV verschenkt – Erst bekommt Greta Thunberg die "Goldene Kamera".

On March 13, 2019, three members of the [[Storting|Norwegian parliament]] nominated Thunberg as a candidate for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] later this year. The nominating politicians motivated their decision by arguing that [[global warming]] will be the cause of "wars, conflict and refugees" if nothing is done to halt it. Thunberg responded that she was "honoured and very grateful" for the nomination.&lt;ref name="av01"/&gt; If Thunberg receives the Prize later this year, she will become the youngest person ever to receive it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ecowatch.com/greta-thunberg-nobel-peace-prize-2631637803.html?rebelltitem=6#rebelltitem6 |title=Greta Thunberg—Swedish Teen who Inspired School Climate Strikes—Nominated for Nobel Peace Prize |author-last=Rosane |author-first=Olivia |date=14 March 2019 |newspaper=EcoWatch |access-date=22 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[Quillette]]'' magazine, Paulina Neuding wonders whether the fame and attention that Greta has received puts excessive pressure on her. Neuding claims that: "A school strike... constitutes a form of self-harm, undertaken to attract adult attention". She writes: "Given what we know about Greta’s problems and challenges, is this (attention) an appropriate adult response to Greta’s school strike?" &lt;ref name="Quillette"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Neuding |first1=Paulina |title=Self-Harm Versus the Greater Good: Greta Thunberg and Child Activism |url=https://quillette.com/2019/04/23/self-harm-versus-the-greater-good-greta-thunberg-and-child-activism/ |website=Quillette |accessdate=25 April 2019 |language=en-AU |date=23 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
