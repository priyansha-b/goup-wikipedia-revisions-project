'''Greta Thunberg''' (born 3 January 2003) is a [[Swedes|Swedish]] climate activist. She is known for her strike outside  the [[Riksdag]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] under the slogan ''Skolstrejk för klimatet''  (''School Strike for the climate'').&lt;ref name="Guardian1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/sep/01/swedish-15-year-old-cutting-class-to-fight-the-climate-crisis |title=The Swedish 15-year-old who's cutting class to fight the climate crisis |date=1 September 2018 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Thunberg was born on 3 January 2003 to Swedish opera singer [[Malena Ernman]] and actor Svante Thunberg, who was named after his descendant, [[Svante Arrhenius]] (on her father's side), who in 1896 was the first person to calculate the greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.democracynow.org/2018/12/11/meet_the_15_year_old_swedish|title=School Strike for Climate: Meet 15-Year-Old Activist Greta Thunberg, Who Inspired a Global Movement|website=Democracy Now!}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian2"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/04/leaders-like-children-school-strike-founder-greta-thunberg-tells-un-climate-summit |title=

== Activism ==
On 20 August 2018, while studying ninth grade in a school in Stockholm, Thunberg decided not to go to the school until the [[Swedish general election, 2018|Swedish general election]] which was held on 9 September 2018. She made the decision after her country faced the unprecedented [[2018 European heat wave|heatwaves]] and [[2018 Sweden wildfires|wildfires]] during the summer.&lt;ref name="Guardian1"/&gt; She demanded that the Swedish government reduce carbon emissions as stated in the [[Paris agreement]] on [[climate change]]. She sat outside the Swedish parliament each day during school hours with the slogan ''school strike for the climate.'' Following the election she continued to protest every Friday.&lt;ref name="Newyorker1" /&gt; On Twitter, she uses hashtags #Klimatstrejka, #ClimateStrike and #FridaysforFuture which feature in media around the world. She participated in the Rise for Climate demonstration outside the [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]] and the Declaration of Rebellion organized by [[Extinction Rebellion]] in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/10/31/our-darkest-hour-declaration-rebellion-new-group-vows-mass-civil-disobedience-save |title=This Is Our Darkest Hour: With Declaration of Rebellion, New Group Vows Mass Civil Disobedience to Save Planet |date=31 October 2018 |work=Common Dreams}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her Friday strike gained worldwide attention. Similar kinds of protests were organized in other countries, including Holland, Germany, Finland, Denmark and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/klimat/klimatmanifestation-over-hela-landet-odesfraga/ |title=Klimatmanifestation över hela landet: ”Ödesfråga” |date=30 November 2018 |work=[[Expressen]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, thousands of school students were inspired by Thunberg to strike on Fridays, ignoring the call of their Prime minister [[Scott Morrison]] who said in the parliament that "what we want is more learning in schools and less activism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://edition-m.cnn.com/2018/11/30/australia/australia-school-climate-strike-scli-intl/index.html?r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.co.in%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dclimate%2Bstrike%2BAustralia%26client%3Ducweb-b%26channel%3Dsb |title=Australian school children defy prime minister with climate strike |date=30 November 2018 |work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December 2018, Thunberg addressed the [[COP24]] United Nations climate change summit.&lt;ref name="carrington-2018"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  She explained the severity of the problem this way:
