'''Naomi Klein''' (b. May 8, 1970, [[Montreal, Quebec]]) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[journalist]], [[author]] and [[Activism|activist]] well known for her political analyses and criticism of corporate [[globalization]].

==Early career==
Klein's writing career started early with contributions to ''[[The Varsity (newspaper)|The Varsity]]'', a [[University of Toronto]] student newspaper, where she served as editor-in-chief. She credits the 1989 [[École Polytechnique massacre]] of female engineering students for her wake-up call to [[feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigthink.com/policy-politics/6340|title=The Montreal Massacre|publisher=Bigthink.com |accessdate=2008-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She dropped out of the University of Toronto to become an intern at the [[Toronto Globe and Mail]], followed by an editorship at [[This Magazine]].

==Career in journalism==
In 2000, Klein published the book ''[[No Logo]]'', which for many became a [[manifesto]] of the [[anti-globalization|anti-corporate globalization movement]]. The book lambastes [[brand name|brand]]-oriented [[consumer culture]] by describing the operations of large [[corporation]]s. These corporations are also accused of being often guilty of exploiting workers in the world's poorest countries in pursuit of ever-greater profits, she writes. Klein criticized [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] so much in the book that Nike published a multi-point response to the issues raised in the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010618162615/http://nikebiz.com/labor/nologo_let.shtml  |archivedate=2001-06-18 |url=http://nikebiz.com/labor/nologo_let.shtml |title=Nike's response to ''No Logo'' |date=2000-03-08 |publisher=[[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''No Logo'' became an international bestseller, selling over one million copies, and has been translated into over 28 languages.&lt;ref name="''The Nation'' bio"&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/directory/bios/naomi_klein The Nation | Unconventional Wisdom Since 1865&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 Klein published ''Fences and Windows'', a collection of articles and speeches she had written on behalf of the anti-globalization movement (all proceeds from the book go to benefit activist organizations through The Fences and Windows Fund). Klein also contributes to ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', ''[[In These Times]]'', ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', ''[[This Magazine]]'', and ''[[The Guardian]]''.

She has continued to write on various current issues, such as the [[occupation of Iraq|war in Iraq]]. In a September 2004 article for ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' entitled ''Baghdad Year Zero: Pillaging Iraq in pursuit of a [[neoconservative|neocon]] utopia'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harpers.org/BaghdadYearZero.html |title=Baghdad year zero: Pillaging Iraq in pursuit of a neocon utopia |year=2004 |month=September |work=Harper's Magazine |publisher=The Harper's Magazine Foundation |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; she argues that, contrary to popular belief and criticisms, the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] did have a clear plan for post-invasion Iraq, which was to build a fully unconstrained [[free market economics|free market economy]]. She describes plans to allow foreigners to extract wealth from Iraq, and the methods used to achieve those goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=04/10/13/144220 Interview] by [[Amy Goodman]] about Klein's article, "James Baker's Double Life", October 13, 2004 (video, audio &amp; print transcript)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/persuaders/interviews/klein.html PBS Frontline: The Persuaders: interview] via KQED, November 9, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 film ''[[War, Inc.]]'' was partially inspired by her article, ''Baghdad Year Zero''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,2159038,00.html 'I'm basically a brand' | Interviews | guardian.co.uk Film&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Klein and her husband, [[Avi Lewis]], released a [[documentary film]] called ''[[The Take (2004 film)|The Take]]'' about factory workers in  [[Argentina]] who [[recovered factory|took over a closed plant]] and resumed production, operating as a [[collective]]. The first African screening was in the Kennedy Road shack settlement in the South African city of [[Durban]], where the [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] movement began.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nplusonemag.com/klein.html "Seattle to Baghdad"] - An assessment of Klein's shift from analyzing 90's corporate culture to the War in Iraq, by Kim Phillips-Fein in [[n+1]] magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein ranked 11th in an internet poll &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Global public intellectuals poll | url=http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=7078 |work=Prospect Magazine |publisher=Prospect Publishing Limited |year=2005 |month=November |first=David |last=Herman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/story/21099/ What Are We Fighting For?] January 27, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://workingtv.com/main3.html Democratic Rights in Wartime] Feb, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[The 2005 Global Intellectuals Poll|top global intellectuals of 2005]], a list of the world's top 100 public intellectuals compiled by the ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Prospect Magazine List of Top 100 Public Intellectuals |url=http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/intellectuals/results.htm |work=Prospect Magazine |publisher=Prospect Publishing Limited |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; in conjunction with ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine. She was the highest ranked woman on the list.

==''The Shock Doctrine''==
{{main|The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism}}
Klein's third book, ''[[The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism]]'', was published on September 4, 2007, becoming an international and [[New York Times bestseller]]&lt;ref name="''The Nation'' bio"/&gt; translated into 20 languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.ca/author/results.pperl?authorid=15909 RandomHouse.ca | Author Spotlight: Naomi Klein&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The book argues that the free market policies of Nobel Laureate [[Milton Friedman]] and the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School of Economics]] have risen to prominence in countries such as [[Chile under Pinochet]], [[Economy of Russia|Russia under Yeltsin]], the United States , and the privatization of Iraq's economy under the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] not because they were democratically popular, but because they were pushed through while the citizens of these countries were in [[shock]] from disasters or upheavals. It is also claimed that these shocks are in some cases, such as the [[Falklands war]], created with the intention of being able to push through these unpopular reforms in the wake of the crisis.

''The Shock Doctrine'' was also adapted into a [[short film]] of the same name, released onto [[YouTube]]. The film was directed by Jonás Cuarón, produced and co-written by his father [[Alfonso Cuarón]]. The video has been viewed over one million times.&lt;ref name="''The Nation'' bio"/&gt;

==Other activities==
Klein once lectured as a Miliband Fellow at the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/miliband/visitingTeachingFellows.htm |title=Visiting teaching fellows |publisher=London School of Economics and Political Science |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein was the keynote speaker at the [[Alliance of Concerned Jewish Canadians]] (ACJC)'s first National conference.

==Criticism==

Klein has been criticized by ''[[The Economist]]'', which noted that her books have been bestsellers and she has profited from them,&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/people/displaystory.cfm?story_id=1429429 Naomi Klein and her flawed brand of anti-brandism] [[The Economist]]&lt;/ref&gt; though in response to this style of criticism Klein has complained of a tendency to 'ignore the reporting, attack the author'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naomiklein.org/articles/2008/09/response-attacks "One Year After the Publication of the Shock Doctrine, A Response to the Attacks"] by Naomi Klein&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Johan Norberg]] has criticized what he described as flaws in ''The Shock Doctrine''.  He pointed out instances in which he believes Klein has distorted history and he criticized the book for what he said was a misleading presentation of Milton Friedman's views and actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=9384 "The Klein Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Polemics"] by Johan Norberg&lt;/ref&gt;  

Klein argued that Norberg's and (''The New Republic'' senior editor) [[Jonathan Chait]]'s criticism have been largely fraudulent, arguing that 'most of the attacks on ''The Shock Doctrine'' involve manufacturing claims, falsely attributing them to me, then handily tearing them down' and complaining that such criticisms have been overly personal. She wrote: 'Again and again, readers of ''The New Republic'' are left with the distinct impression that ''The Shock Doctrine'' is a work of opinion journalism, rather than a thesis based on research and reporting.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naomiklein.org/articles/2008/09/response-attacks "One Year After the Publication of The Shock Doctrine, A Response to the Attacks"] by Naomi Klein.&lt;/ref&gt;

Norberg has subsequently responded to Klein's defense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=9626 "Three Days After Klein's Response, Another Attack"] by Johan Norberg&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein has been criticized for her portrail of [[Peron]] in her documentary film [[The_Take_(2004_film)|"The Take"]], which makes him appear to be a social democrat.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/7824&lt;/ref&gt;
