'''Naomi Klein'''  is a [[Canadian]] [[journalist]], [[author]] and [[Activism|activist]]. 

Her grandfather was fired for [[labour movement|labor]] organizing at [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] in the [[United States]]. Her father Michael, a physician, was a [[Vietnam War]] resister ([[draft dodger]]) and became a member of [[Physicians for Social Responsibility]]. Her film-maker mother, Bonnie, won fame with her [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography]] film, ''Not a Love Story''.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Klein movie: ''[http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC30folder/NotLoveStory.html Not a love story]''&lt;/ref&gt; Her brother Seth is director of the [[Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives]]. Klein's writing career started early with contributions to ''[[The Varsity (newspaper)|The Varsity]]'', a [[University of Toronto]] student newspaper. She served as editor-in-chief of the newspaper. She credits her wake-up call to [[feminism]] as the [[1989]] [[École Polytechnique massacre]] of female engineering students.

In [[2000]], Klein published the book ''[[No Logo]]'', which for many became a [[manifesto]] of the [[anti-globalization movement]]. This movement had shut down the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO Meeting of 1999]] one month before the release of ''No Logo''. The book lambasts [[brand name|brand]]-oriented [[consumer culture]] by describing the operations of large [[corporation]]s. These corporations are also often guilty of exploiting workers in the world's poorest countries in pursuit of ever-greater profits, she writes. Klein criticized [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] so much in the book that it became one of the first publications to receive feedback from the company.&lt;ref&gt;Web Archive: [http://web.archive.org/web/20010618162615/http://nikebiz.com/labor/nologo_let.shtml Nike's response to ''No Logo'']. March 8, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[2002]] Klein published ''Fences and Windows'', a collection of articles and speeches she had written on behalf of the anti-[[globalization]] movement (all proceeds from the book go to benefit activist organizations through The Fences and Windows Fund). Klein also contributes to ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', ''[[In These Times]]'', [[Canada]]'s ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', ''[[This Magazine]]'', and ''[[The Guardian]]''. 

She has continued to write on various current issues, such as the [[occupation of Iraq|war in Iraq]]. In a September 2004 article for ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' entitled "Baghdad Year Zero: Pillaging Iraq in pursuit of a [[neoconservative|neocon]] [[utopia]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harpers.org/BaghdadYearZero.html Baghdad Year Zero]&lt;/ref&gt; she argues that, contrary to popular belief and criticisms, the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] did have a clear plan for post-invasion Iraq, which was to build a fully unconstrained [[free market economics|free market economy]]. She describes plans to allow foreigners to extract wealth from Iraq, and the methods used to achieve those goals.

Also in 2004, Klein and her husband, Avi Lewis, released a [[documentary film]] called ''[[The Take]]'', about factory workers in  [[Argentina]] who took over the closed plant and resumed production, operating as a [[collective]]. The first African screening was in the Kennedy Road shack settlement in the South African city of [[Durban]] where the [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] movement began.

In October 2005, Klein was ranked 11th in the [[The 2005 Global Intellectuals Poll]], a list of the world's top 100 public intellectuals compiled by ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Prospect Magazine List of Top 100 Public Intellectuals|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/intellectuals/results}}&lt;/ref&gt; in conjunction with ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine. She was the highest ranked woman on the list. ''Prospect'' based the list and its rankings entirely on an Internet poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Global public intellectuals poll | url=http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=7078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naomi Klein's third book, ''The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism'', will be published worldwide in September 2007.
