'''Greta Thunberg''' (born 3 January 2003) is a [[Swedes|Swedish]] climate activist. She is known for [[student strike|striking]] outside the [[Riksdag|Swedish parliament building]] to raise [[climate change]] activism.&lt;ref name="Guardian1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/sep/01/swedish-15-year-old-cutting-class-to-fight-the-climate-crisis |title=The Swedish 15-year-old who's cutting class to fight the climate crisis |date=1 September 2018 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Thunberg was born on 3 January 2003. Her mother is [[Malena Ernman]], a Swedish opera singer. Thunberg's father is Svante Thunberg, who is an actor named after [[Svante Arrhenius]]. Arrhenius is an ancestor of her father, and won a [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for calculating the effects of [[greenhouse gas]]es in the [[atmosphere of earth|atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.democracynow.org/2018/12/11/meet_the_15_year_old_swedish|title=School Strike for Climate: Meet 15-Year-Old Activist Greta Thunberg, Who Inspired a Global Movement|website=Democracy Now!}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian2"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/04/leaders-like-children-school-strike-founder-greta-thunberg-tells-un-climate-summit |title='Our leaders are like children,' school strike founder tells climate summit |date=4 December 2018 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her grandfather is [[Olof Thunberg]], an actor and a director.

Greta Thunberg has been diagnosed with [[Asperger's syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Newyorker1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-fifteen-year-old-climate-activist-who-is-demanding-a-new-kind-of-politics |title=The Fifteen-Year-Old Climate Activist Who Is Demanding a New Kind of Politics |date=2 October 2018 |website=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism ==
On 20 August 2018, Thunberg, then in ninth grade, decided to not attend school until the [[Swedish general election, 2018|2018 Sweden general election]] on 9 September after [[2018 European heat wave|heat waves]] and [[2018 Sweden wildfires|wildfires]] in Sweden.&lt;ref name="Guardian1"/&gt; Her demands were that the Sweden government reduce carbon emissions as per the [[Paris Agreement]], and she protested via sitting outside the [[Riksdag]] every day during school hours with the sign "''Skolstrejk för klimatet''" (school strike for the climate).&lt;ref name="Newyorker1" /&gt;

After the general elections, she continued to strike only on Fridays, which gained worldwide attention. Similar protests were organized in other countries, including Holland, Germany, Finland and Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/klimat/klimatmanifestation-over-hela-landet-odesfraga/ |title=Klimatmanifestation över hela landet: ”Ödesfråga” |date=30 November 2018 |work=[[Expressen]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, thousands of school students were inspired by Thunberg to strike on Fridays, ignoring Prime Minister [[Scott Morrison]]'s comments of " more learning in schools and less activism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://edition-m.cnn.com/2018/11/30/australia/australia-school-climate-strike-scli-intl/index.html?r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.co.in%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dclimate%2Bstrike%2BAustralia%26client%3Ducweb-b%26channel%3Dsb |title=Australian school children defy prime minister with climate strike |date=30 November 2018 |work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Twitter]], she used hashtags and spread online awareness. Thunburg participated in the Rise for Climate demonstration outside the [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]] and the Declaration of Rebellion organized by [[Extinction Rebellion]] in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/10/31/our-darkest-hour-declaration-rebellion-new-group-vows-mass-civil-disobedience-save |title=This Is Our Darkest Hour: With Declaration of Rebellion, New Group Vows Mass Civil Disobedience to Save Planet |date=31 October 2018 |work=Common Dreams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December 2018, Thunberg addressed the [[COP24]] United Nations climate change summit.&lt;ref name="carrington-2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Carrington |first1 = Damian |title = 'Our leaders are like children', school strike founder tells climate summit |date = 4 December 2018 |work = The Guardian |location = London, United Kingdom |issn = 0261-3077 |url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/04/leaders-like-children-school-strike-founder-greta-thunberg-tells-un-climate-summit |access-date = 2018-12-04}}
