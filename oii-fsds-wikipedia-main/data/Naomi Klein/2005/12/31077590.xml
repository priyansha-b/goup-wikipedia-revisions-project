<text bytes="5909" sha1="ks13gtxwhmq6eh7ytu20daz5mk1bnma" xml:space="preserve">[[Naomi Klein]] (born [[1970]]) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[journalist]], [[author]] and [[Activism|activist]]. She was born into a political family in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], and now lives in [[Toronto]] with her husband [[Avi Lewis]]. 

Her grandfather was fired for labor organizing at [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]].  Her father Michael, a physician, was a [[Vietnam War]] resistor who fled to Canada and became  a member of [[Physicians for Social Responsibility]].  Her film-maker mother, Bonnie, won fame with her ground-breaking anti-pornography film, ''Not a Love Story''. Her brother Seth is director of the [[Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives]].  Klein's writing career started early with contributions to ''[[The Varsity (newspaper)|The Varsity]]'', a [[University of Toronto]] student newspaper.  She credits her wake-up call to [[feminism]] as the [[1989]] [[École Polytechnique massacre]] of female engineering students.

In [[2000]], Klein published the book ''[[No Logo]]'', which for many became a [[manifesto]] of the [[anti-globalization movement]].  This movement had shut down the [[WTO Meeting of 1999]] one month before the release of ''No Logo''. The book lambasts the negative effects of brand-oriented consumer culture by describing the operations of large corporations which exist only to peddle a brand. Their products, she argues, turn people into walking billboards. These corporations are also often guilty of exploiting workers in the world's poorest countries in pursuit of ever-greater profits. Klein criticized Nike so much in the book that it became one of the first publications to receive feedback from [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]].[http://web.archive.org/web/20010618162615/http://nikebiz.com/labor/nologo_let.shtml]

In [[2002]] Klein published ''[[Fences and Windows]]'', a collection of articles and speeches she had written on behalf of the anti-globalization movement (all proceeds from the book go to benefit activist organizations through [[The Fences and Windows Fund]]). Klein also contributes to ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', ''[[In These Times]]'', [[Canada]]'s ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', ''[[This Magazine]]'', and ''[[The Guardian]]''. 

She has continued to write on various current issues, such as the [[occupation of Iraq]]. In a September 2004 article for ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' entitled "Baghdad Year Zero: Pillaging Iraq in pursuit of a neocon utopia", she argues that, contrary to popular belief and criticisms, the Bush Administration did have a clear plan for post-invasion Iraq, which was to build a fully unconstrained free market [[economy]]. She describes plans to allow foreigners to extract wealth from Iraq, and the methods used to achieve those goals.

Klein gave the annual [[Dalton Camp|Dalton K. Camp]] Lecture in Journalism on [[October 28]], [[2004]] at [[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)|St. Thomas University]] in [[Fredericton, New Brunswick]]. She also spoke at the tenth anniversary celebration of [[Stauffer Library]] at [[Queen's University, Canada|Queen's University]], [[Kingston, Ontario]] on [[November 4]], [[2004]], and at the Navigating A New World Conference on [[November 6]], along with [[Lloyd Axworthy]], [[Linda McQuaig]], [[Roméo Dallaire]], [[Thomas Homer-Dixon]], and [[Irshad Manji]].

Also in 2004, Klein and her husband, Canadian television journalist [[Avi Lewis]], released a [[documentary film]] called ''[[The Take]]'', which profiled a group of [[layoff|laid off]] auto-parts workers in [[Argentina]] who took back control of their plant and turned it into a [[cooperative]].

In October 2005, Naomi Klein was ranked 11th on the list of the world's top 100 public intellectuals in a poll  conducted by Prospect magazine [http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/intellectuals/results] in conjunction with Foreign Policy magazine.
