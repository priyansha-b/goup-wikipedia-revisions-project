Klein wrote the book ''[[No Logo]]'' ([[2000]]), which became a [[manifesto]] of the [[anti-globalization movement]].  She has also written ''[[Fences and Windows]]'' ([[2002]]) and contributes to ''[[The Nation]]'', ''[[In These Times]]'', [[Canada]]'s ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', and ''[[The Guardian]]'' in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].

''No Logo'' was one of the first publications to receive feedback from [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], a company Klein frequently criticises in the book.

Klein is married to Canadian television journalist [[Avi Lewis]].
