'''Greta Thunberg''' (born 3 January 2003) is a [[Swedes|Swedish]] climate activist. She is known for her strike outside  the Swedish parliament ([[Riksdag]]) in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] under the slogan ''Skolstrejk för klimatet''  (''School Strike for the climate'').&lt;ref name="Guardian1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/sep/01/swedish-15-year-old-cutting-class-to-fight-the-climate-crisis |title=The Swedish 15-year-old who's cutting class to fight the climate crisis |date=1 September 2018 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Thunberg was born on 3 January 2003. Her mother is Swedish opera singer [[Malena Ernman]]. Her father is actor Svante Thunberg, who was named after his ancestor and Nobel Prize winner, [[Svante Arrhenius]], who in 1896 was the first person to calculate the greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.democracynow.org/2018/12/11/meet_the_15_year_old_swedish|title=School Strike for Climate: Meet 15-Year-Old Activist Greta Thunberg, Who Inspired a Global Movement|website=Democracy Now!}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian2"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/04/leaders-like-children-school-strike-founder-greta-thunberg-tells-un-climate-summit |title=

She has been diagnosed with [[Asperger syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Newyorker1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-fifteen-year-old-climate-activist-who-is-demanding-a-new-kind-of-politics |title=The Fifteen-Year-Old Climate Activist Who Is Demanding a New Kind of Politics |date=2 October 2018 |website=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism ==
On 20 August 2018, while studying ninth grade in a school in Stockholm, Thunberg decided not to go to the school until the [[Swedish general election, 2018|Swedish general election]] which was held on 9 September 2018. She made the decision after her country faced the unprecedented [[2018 European heat wave|heatwaves]] and [[2018 Sweden wildfires|wildfires]] during the summer.&lt;ref name="Guardian1"/&gt; She demanded that the Swedish government reduce carbon emissions as stated in the [[Paris agreement]] on [[climate change]]. She sat outside the Swedish parliament each day during school hours with the slogan ''school strike for the climate.'' Following the election she continued to protest every Friday.&lt;ref name="Newyorker1" /&gt; On Twitter, she uses hashtags #Klimatstrejka, #ClimateStrike and #FridaysforFuture which feature in media around the world. She participated in the Rise for Climate demonstration outside the [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]] and the Declaration of Rebellion organized by [[Extinction Rebellion]] in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/10/31/our-darkest-hour-declaration-rebellion-new-group-vows-mass-civil-disobedience-save |title=This Is Our Darkest Hour: With Declaration of Rebellion, New Group Vows Mass Civil Disobedience to Save Planet |date=31 October 2018 |work=Common Dreams}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her Friday strike gained worldwide attention. Similar kinds of protests were organized in other countries, including Holland, Germany, Finland, Denmark and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/klimat/klimatmanifestation-over-hela-landet-odesfraga/ |title=Klimatmanifestation över hela landet: ”Ödesfråga” |date=30 November 2018 |work=[[Expressen]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, thousands of school students were inspired by Thunberg to strike on Fridays, ignoring the call of their Prime minister [[Scott Morrison]] who said in the parliament that "what we want is more learning in schools and less activism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://edition-m.cnn.com/2018/11/30/australia/australia-school-climate-strike-scli-intl/index.html?r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.co.in%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dclimate%2Bstrike%2BAustralia%26client%3Ducweb-b%26channel%3Dsb |title=Australian school children defy prime minister with climate strike |date=30 November 2018 |work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December 2018, Thunberg addressed the [[COP24]] United Nations climate change summit.&lt;ref name="carrington-2018"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  She explained the severity of the problem this way:

You only talk about moving forward with the same bad ideas that got us into this mess, even when the only sensible thing to do is pull the emergency brake. You are not mature enough to tell it like it is. Even that burden you leave to us children.
