'''Naomi Klein''' (born May 8, 1970) is a Canadian author and [[Activism|social activist]] known for her political analyses and [[anti-globalisation|criticism of corporate globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=10110 |title=The Shock Doctrine |first=Chris |last=Nineham |date=October 2007 |accessdate=April 25, 2011 |work=[[Socialist Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is best known for ''[[No Logo]]'', a book that went on to become an international bestseller, and ''[[The Shock Doctrine]],'' a critical analysis of the history of neoliberal economics.

==Family==
Naomi Klein was born in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], and brought up in a [[Jew]]ish family with a history of [[Peace movement|peace activism]]. Her parents were self-described "hippies"&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Naomi.  No Logo (2000: Vintage Canada), pp. 143-4.&lt;/ref&gt; who moved to Montreal from the U.S. in 1967 as [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|war resisters]] to the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="doc_townhall"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjUu57Ln7L0/|title= Video: Naomi Klein addresses the Department of Culture Town Hall|accessdate= 2012-07-26|date= September 4, 2008|publisher= Department Of Culture}}{{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her mother, [[documentary]] [[film-maker]] [[Bonnie Sherr Klein]], is best known for her [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography]] film ''[[Not a Love Story]]''.&lt;ref name="bonnie_sherr_klein_bio"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/women/002026-704-e.html|title= Biography of Bonnie Sherr Klein (*1941): Filmmaker, Author, Disability Rights Activist|publisher= Library and Archives Canada}}{{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, Michael Klein, is a physician and a member of [[Physicians for Social Responsibility]]. Her brother, Seth Klein, is director of the [[British Columbia]] office of the [[Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives]].

Her paternal grandparents were communists who began to turn against the Soviet Union after the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] and had abandoned [[communism]] by 1956. In 1942, her grandfather Phil Klein, an animator at [[Disney]], was fired after the [[Disney animators' strike]],&lt;ref name="tom_sito_disney"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://animationguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/PB200606.pdf|title= The Disney Strike of 1941: How It Changed Animation &amp; Comics|accessdate= March 25, 2009|first= Tom |last=Sito|date= July 19, 2005|publisher= Animation World Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went to work at a shipyard instead. Klein's father grew up surrounded by ideas of [[social justice]] and [[racial equality]], but found it "difficult and frightening to be the child of Communists", a so-called [[red diaper baby]].&lt;ref name="nyer"/&gt;

Klein's husband, [[Avi Lewis]], works as a TV journalist and documentary filmmaker. The couple's first child, son Toma, was born on June 13, 2012.&lt;ref name="Naomi_Klein_Facebook_Page"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.facebook.com/pages/Naomi-Klein/12400234918|title=Naomi Klein|publisher=Facebook|date=March 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Klein spent much of her teenage years in [[shopping mall]]s, obsessed with [[designer label]]s.&lt;ref name="Hand-to-Brand"/&gt; As a child and teenager, she found it "very oppressive to have a very public feminist mother" and she rejected politics, instead embracing "full-on [[consumerism]]".

She has attributed her change in worldview to two events. One was when she was 17 and preparing for the [[University of Toronto]], her mother had a stroke and became severely disabled.&lt;ref name="abilities"/&gt; Naomi, her father, and her brother took care of Bonnie through the period in hospital and at home, making educational sacrifices to do so.&lt;ref name="abilities"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.enablelink.org/include/article.php?pid=&amp;cid=&amp;subid=&amp;aid=673|title= We are Who You are:Feminism and Disability|accessdate= 2009-02-17|first= Bonnie Sherr |last=Klein|date= Spring 1993|work= Abilities|publisher= Enablelink.org}}{{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year off prevented her "from being such a brat".&lt;ref name="Hand-to-Brand"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.commondreams.org/views/092300-103.htm|title= Hand-To-Brand-Combat: A Profile Of Naomi Klein|accessdate= 2009-02-17|first= Katharine |last=Viner|date= September 23, 2000|publisher= The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, after beginning her studies at the [[University of Toronto]], the second event occurred: the 1989 [[École Polytechnique massacre]] of female engineering students, which proved to be a wake-up call to [[feminism]].&lt;ref name="montreal-massacre"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eET3COi8DPY|title= Naomi Klein: The Montreal Massacre |publisher= Youtube.com|accessdate= 2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein's writing career started with contributions to ''[[The Varsity (newspaper)|The Varsity]]'', a student newspaper, where she served as editor-in-chief.  After her third year at the University of Toronto, she dropped out of university to take a job at the ''[[Toronto Globe and Mail]]'', followed by an editorship at ''[[This Magazine]]''. In 1995, she returned to the University of Toronto with the intention of finishing her degree&lt;ref name="nyer"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/12/08/081208fa_fact_macfarquhar?currentPage=all|title= Outside Agitator: Naomi Klein and the New Left|first= Larissa |last=MacFarquhar|date= December 8, 2008|publisher= [[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but left academia for a journalism internship before acquiring the final credits required to complete her degree.&lt;ref&gt;Q&amp;A Interview with Brian Lamb, on CSPAN, dated November 29, 2009, [http://www.q-and-a.org/Program/index.asp?ProgramID=1260 Klein Q&amp;A interview and transcript]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major works==

===''No Logo''===

{{Main|No Logo}}
In 2000, Klein published the book ''[[No Logo]]'', which for many became a [[manifesto]] of the [[anti-globalization|anti-corporate globalization movement]]. In it, she attacks [[brand name|brand]]-oriented [[consumer culture]] and the operations of large [[corporation]]s. She also accuses several such corporations of unethically exploiting workers in the world's poorest countries in pursuit of greater profits. In this book, Klein criticized [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] so severely that Nike published a point-by-point response.&lt;ref name="no-logo-nike"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20010618162615/http://nikebiz.com/labor/nologo_let.shtml  |archivedate= 2001-06-18|url= http://nikebiz.com/labor/nologo_let.shtml|title= Nike's response to ''No Logo''|date= 2000-03-08|publisher= [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''No Logo'' became an international bestseller, selling over one million copies in over 28 languages.&lt;ref name="Nation-bio"/&gt;

===''Fences and Windows''===
[[File:Naomi Klein speaking at LSE, 14th October 2002.jpg|thumb|Klein speaking in 2002]]
{{Main|Fences and Windows}}
In 2002, Klein published ''[[Fences and Windows]]'', a collection of her articles and speeches written on behalf of the [[anti-globalization]] movement (all proceeds from the book go to benefit activist organizations through The Fences and Windows Fund).{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===''The Take''===

{{Main|The Take (2004 film)}}
In 2004, Klein and her husband, [[Avi Lewis]], released a [[documentary film]] called ''[[The Take (2004 film)|The Take]]'' about factory workers in [[Argentina]] who [[recovered factory|took over a closed plant]] and resumed production, operating as a [[collective]]. The first African screening was in the Kennedy Road shack settlement in the South African city of [[Durban]], where the [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] movement began.&lt;ref name="Phillips-Fein"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nplusonemag.com/klein.html|title= Seattle to Baghdad|accessdate= 2009-02-17|first= Kim |last=Phillips-Fein|date= May 10, 2005|publisher= [[n+1]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one article in ''[[Z Communications]]'' criticized ''The Take'' for its portrayal of the Argentine general and politician [[Juan Domingo Perón]], which they felt portrayed him as a social democrat.&lt;ref name="the_take"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://zcomm.org/znetarticle/the-take-by-daniel-morduchowicz-1|title= The Take|accessdate=2009-02-17|first= Daniel |last=Morduchowicz|date= September 20, 2004|publisher=Z Space}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Shock Doctrine''===
[[File:Naomi Klein Warsaw Nov. 19 2008 Fot Mariusz Kubik 03.jpg|thumbnail|Klein in 2008 with the Polish edition of ''Shock Doctrine'']]
{{Main|The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism}}
Klein's third book, ''The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism'', was published on September 4, 2007, becoming an international and [[New York Times bestseller]]&lt;ref name="Nation-bio"/&gt; translated into 28 languages.&lt;ref name="RandomHouse"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.randomhouse.ca/author/results.pperl?authorid=15909|title= Author Spotlight: Naomi Klein |accessdate= 2009-02-17|publisher= RandomHouse.ca}}{{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book argues that the free market policies of Nobel Laureate [[Milton Friedman]] and the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School of Economics]] have risen to prominence in countries such as [[Military government of Chile (1973–1990)|Chile, under Pinochet]], Poland, [[Economy of Russia|Russia, under Yeltsin]], and the United States (for example, the privatization of the [[New Orleans Public Schools]] after [[Hurricane Katrina]]). The book also argues that policy initiatives (for instance, the privatization of Iraq's economy under the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]]) were rushed through while the citizens of these countries were in shock from disasters, upheavals, or invasion.

Central to the book's thesis is the contention that those who wish to implement unpopular [[free market]] policies now routinely do so by taking advantage of certain features of the aftermath of major disasters, be they economic, political, military or natural. The suggestion is that when a society experiences a major 'shock' there is a widespread desire for a rapid and decisive response to correct the situation; this desire for bold and immediate action provides an opportunity for unscrupulous actors to implement policies which go far beyond a legitimate response to disaster. The book suggests that when the rush to act means the specifics of a response will go unscrutinized, that is the moment when unpopular and unrelated policies will intentionally be rushed into effect. The book appears to claim that these shocks are in some cases intentionally encouraged or even manufactured.

Klein identifies the "shock doctrine", elaborating on [[Joseph Schumpeter]], as the latest in capitalism's phases of "creative destruction".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/cockburn09222007.html|title=On Naomi Klein's "The Shock Doctrine"|publisher=[[CounterPunch]]|first=Alexander |last=Cockburn|date=September 22–23, 2007|authorlink=Alexander Cockburn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Shock Doctrine'' was adapted into a [[short film]] of the same name, released onto [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iW1SHPgUAQ The Shock Doctrine 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The film was directed by [[Jonás Cuarón]], produced and co-written by his father [[Alfonso Cuarón]]. The video has been viewed over one million times.&lt;ref name="Nation-bio"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thenation.com/directory/bios/naomi_klein|title= Unconventional Wisdom Since 1865|publisher= The Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of ''The Shock Doctrine'' increased Klein's prominence, with the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' judging her "the most visible and influential figure on the American left—what [[Howard Zinn]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] were thirty years ago." On February 24, 2009, the book was awarded the inaugural [[Warwick Prize for Writing]] from the [[University of Warwick]] in England. The prize carried a cash award of £50,000.

===''This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate''===
Klein's fourth book, ''[[This Changes Everything|This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate]]'' was published in September 2014.&lt;ref name='Penguin'&gt;{{cite web|title=This Changes Everything|url=http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9781846145056,00.html|work=This Changes Everything|publisher=Penguin Books|accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is a shortlisted nominee for the 2014 [[Hilary Weston Writers' Trust Prize for Nonfiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/books/2014/09/hilary-weston-prize-2014-the-shortlist-revealed.html "Hilary Weston Prize 2014: The shortlist revealed!"]. [[CBC Arts|CBC Books]], September 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iraq War criticism==

Klein has written on various current issues, such as the [[Iraq War]]. In a September 2004 article for ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'',&lt;ref name="Harpers"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.harpers.org/BaghdadYearZero.html|title= Baghdad year zero: Pillaging Iraq in pursuit of a neocon utopia|first= Naomi |last=Klein|date=September 2004|work= [[Harper's Magazine]]|publisher= The Harper's Magazine Foundation|accessdate= 2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; she argues that, contrary to popular belief, the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] did have a clear plan for post-invasion Iraq, which was to build a completely unconstrained [[free market economics|free market economy]]. She describes plans to allow foreigners to extract wealth from Iraq, and the methods used to achieve those goals.&lt;ref name="Democracy-Now"&gt;{{cite interview|last= Klein|first= Naomi|title=Broadcast Exclusive: James Baker’s Double Life in Iraq: The Carlyle Group Stands to Make Killing on Iraqi Debt |interviewer= [[Amy Goodman]]|program= [[Democracy Now!]] |callsign= [[Pacifica Radio]]|date= 2004-10-13|accessdate= 2009-02-17|url= http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=04/10/13/144220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite interview|last= Klein|first= Naomi|subjectlink=|title= The Persuaders: Interview Naomi Klein|callsign = [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|date= January 22, 2004|program= [[PBS Frontline]] |accessdate= 2009-02-17|url= http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/persuaders/interviews/klein.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 film ''[[War, Inc.]]'' was partially inspired by her article, ''Baghdad Year Zero''.&lt;ref name="film.guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,2159038,00.html|title= I'm basically a brand (article about John Cusack's career)|accessdate= 2009-02-17|first= Ryan |last=Gilbey|date= August 31, 2007|publisher= The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein's August 2004 "Bring Najaf to New York", published in ''The Nation'', argued that [[Muqtada Al Sadr]]'s [[Mahdi Army]] "represents the overwhelmingly mainstream sentiment in Iraq."&lt;ref name="Najif-Nation"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thenation.com/doc/20040913/klein|title= Bring Najaf to New York|accessdate=2009-02-17|first= Naomi |last=Klein|date= August 26, 2004|work=[[The Nation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to say "Yes, if elected Sadr would try to turn Iraq into a theocracy like Iran, but for now his demands are for direct elections and an end to foreign occupation".&lt;ref name="Najif-Nation"/&gt; [[Marc Cooper]], a former ''Nation'' columnist, attacked the assertion that Al Sadr represented mainstream Iraqi sentiment and that American forces had brought the fight to the holy city of Najaf.&lt;ref name="MarcCooper"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://marccooper.typepad.com/marccooper/2004/08/najaf_to_new_yo.html|title= Najaf to New York? Better: New York to Najaf.|accessdate= 2009-02-17|first= Marc |last=Cooper|date= August 27, 2004|publisher=marccooper.typepad.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper wrote that "Klein should know better. All enemies of the U.S. occupation she opposes are not her friends. Or ours. Or those of the Iraqi people. I don’t think that Mullah Al Sadr, in any case, is much desirous of support issuing from secular Jewish feminist-socialists."&lt;ref name = "MarcCooper"/&gt;

==Criticism of Israeli policies==

In March 2008, Klein was the keynote speaker at the first national conference of the [[Independent Jewish Voices (Canada)|Alliance of Concerned Jewish Canadians]].  In January 2009, during the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]], Klein supported the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] (BDS) campaign against [[Israel]], arguing that "the best strategy to end the increasingly bloody occupation is for Israel to become the target of the kind of global movement that put an end to apartheid in South Africa."&lt;ref name="time-for-boycott"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jan/10/naomi-klein-boycott-israel|title= Enough. It's time for a boycott|accessdate= 2009-07-13|first= Naomi |last=Klein|date= January 10, 2009|publisher= The Guardian | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 2009, on the occasion of the publication of the [[Hebrew]] translation of her book ''The Shock Doctrine'', Klein visited Israel, the [[West Bank]], and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]], combining the promotion of her book and the BDS campaign. In an interview to the Israeli newspaper ''[[Ha'aretz]]'' she emphasized that it is important to her "not to boycott Israelis but rather to boycott the normalization of Israel and the conflict."&lt;ref name="klein_haaretz"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1097058.html|title= Oppose the state, not the people|accessdate=2009-07-13|first= Naomi |last=Klein|date= July 2, 2009|publisher= [[Ha'aretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech in [[Ramallah]] on 27 June, she apologized to the [[Palestinians]] for not joining the BDS campaign earlier.&lt;ref name="klein_ramallah"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://thefastertimes.com/Palestine/2009/07/07/naomi-klein-in-ramallah-i-am-ashamed-that-it-took-me-this-long-to-endorse-the-call-to-boycott-israel…it-was-nothing-but-cowardice/|title= Naomi Klein in Ramallah: I am ashamed that it took me this long|accessdate= 2009-07-13|first= Naomi |last=Klein|date= July 7, 2009|publisher= The Faster Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her remarks, particularly that "[Some Jews] even think we get one get-away-with-genocide-free-card" were characterized by an op-ed columnist in the ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' as "violent" and "unethical", and as the "most perverse of aspersions on Jews, an age-old stereotype of Jews as intrinsically evil and malicious."&lt;ref name="schimmel"&gt;{{cite news|title= 'The Jews' get-away-with-genocide-free-card'|newspaper= [[Jerusalem Post]]|first= Noam |last=Schimmel |url= http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1246443842069&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|date= July 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein was also a spokesperson for the protest against the [[2009 Toronto International Film Festival#Controversy over Tel Aviv spotlight|spotlight on Tel Aviv]] at the [[2009 Toronto International Film Festival]], a spotlight that Klein said was a very selective and misleading portrait of Israel.&lt;ref name="globe_and_mail"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/we-dont-feel-like-celebrating-with-israel-this-year/article1278582/|title= We don't feel like celebrating with Israel this year.|first= Naomi |last=Klein|newspaper= [[Globe and Mail]] |date= September 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmentalism==
Since 2009, Klein’s attention has turned to environmentalism, with particular focus on [[climate change]], about which she is currently writing a book.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.democracynow.org/2011/3/9/my_fear_is_that_climate_change&lt;/ref&gt; According to her website, the book and a new film will be about "how the climate crisis can spur economic and political transformation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naomiklein.org/meet-naomi Meet Naomi], Naomi Klein Official Web Site&lt;/ref&gt; She sits on the board of directors of campaign group [[350.org]]&lt;ref&gt;350.org Our Team: http://www.350.org/en/our-team&lt;/ref&gt; and took part in their 'Do the Math' tour in 2013, encouraging a divestment movement.&lt;ref&gt;Naomi Klein does the math: http://www.350.org/en/about/blogs/naomi-klein-does-math&lt;/ref&gt;

She has encouraged the [[Occupy movement]] to join forces with the environmental movement, saying the financial crisis and the climate crisis have the same root – unrestrained corporate greed.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJ8CoxnjjZg |title=Naomi Klein: Obama's Delay of Keystone XL Oil Pipeline Decision is Win for Environmentalists |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-11-11 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; She gave a speech at [[Occupy Wall Street]] where she described the world as ‘upside down’, where we act as if ‘there is no end to what is actually finite—fossil fuels and the atmospheric space to absorb their emissions’, and as if there are ‘limits to what is actually bountiful—the financial resources to build the kind of society we need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/163844/occupy-wall-street-most-important-thing-world-now# |title=Occupy Wall Street: The Most Important Thing in the World Now |publisher=The Nation |date=2011-10-06 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has been a particularly vocal critic of the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] in Alberta, describing it in a [[TED Talk|TED talk]] as a form of ‘terrestrial skinning’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TEDWomen |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/naomi_klein_addicted_to_risk.html |title=Naomi Klein: Addicted to risk &amp;#124; Video on |publisher=Ted.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 2, 2011, she attended the demonstration against the [[Keystone XL]] pipeline outside the White House and was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Posted: Sep 2, 2011 5:34 PM ET |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2011/09/02/world-naomi-klein-arrested-at-white-house-keystone-pipeline-protest.html |title=Naomi Klein arrested at D.C. pipeline protest - World - CBC News |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2011-09-02 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klein celebrated Obama’s decision to postpone a decision on the [[Keystone pipeline]] until 2013 pending an environmental review as a victory for the environmental movement.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

She attended the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Copenhagen Climate Summit of 2009]]. She put the blame for the failure of Copenhagen on Barack Obama,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/dec/21/copenhagen-failure-obama-climate-change |title=Copenhagen's failure belongs to Obama &amp;#124; Naomi Klein &amp;#124; Comment is free &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=2009-12-21 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and described her own country, Canada, as a ‘climate criminal’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO9G1r2aBEo |title=Naomi Klein Implicates Corporate Climate Lobbyists at COP15 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; She presented the Angry Mermaid Award (a satirical award designed to recognise the corporations who have best sabotaged the climate negotiations) to [[Monsanto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge864JnnVm0 |title=Naomi Klein gives 'Angry Mermaid Award' in Copenhagen |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-12-15 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the wake of [[Hurricane Sandy]] she warned that the climate crisis constitutes a massive opportunity for disaster capitalists and corporations seeking to profit from crisis. But equally, the climate crisis 'can be a historic moment to usher in the next great wave of progressive change', or a so-called 'People's Shock'.&lt;ref&gt;''The Nation'', "[http://www.thenation.com/article/171048/super-storm-sandy-peoples-shock# Superstorm Sandy - a People's Shock?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other activities==

Klein contributes to ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', ''[[In These Times]]'', ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', ''[[This Magazine]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', and ''[[The Guardian]]''.
