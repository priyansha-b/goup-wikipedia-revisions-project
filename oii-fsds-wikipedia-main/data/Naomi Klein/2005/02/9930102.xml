<text bytes="4256" sha1="072s184k2uq7tsndni5ywm6of863ynv" xml:space="preserve">'''Naomi Klein''' (born [[1970]]) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[journalist]], [[author]] and [[Activism|activist]]. She was born in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], and now lives in [[Toronto]]. 

Klein wrote the book ''[[No Logo]]'' ([[2000]]), which became a [[manifesto]] of the [[anti-globalization movement]].  She has also written ''[[Fences and Windows]]'' ([[2002]]) and contributes to ''[[The Nation]]'', ''[[In These Times]]'', [[Canada]]'s ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', and ''[[This Magazine]]'', and ''[[The Guardian]]'' in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].

''No Logo'' is her best-known work, where she lambastes the negative effects of brand-oriented consumer culture. What makes No Logo especially relevant was that it was released only a month after mass anti-globalization protests in [[Seattle]] shut down the 1999 World Trade Organization meeting. 

Klein describes the operations of large corporations which exist only to peddle a brand. Their products, she argues, turn people into walking billboards. On a more subtle note, these corporations are often guilty of exploiting workers in the world's poorest countries in pursuit of ever-greater profits. Klein criticized Nike so much in the book that it became one of the first publications to receive feedback from [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]].

Since No Logo, she has continued to write on various emerging issues, such as the invasion of [[Iraq]]. In a September 2004 article for [[Harper's Magazine]] entitled "''Baghdad Year Zero: Pillaging Iraq in pursuit of a neocon utopia''", she argues that, contrary to popular belief and criticisms, the Bush Administration did have a clear plan for post-invasion Iraq, which was to build a fully unconstrained free market [[economy]]. She describes plans to allow foreigners to extract wealth from Iraq, and the methods used to achieve those goals.

Her writing career started early, contributing to the Varsity, one of the [[University of Toronto]]'s student newspapers. Klein is married to Canadian television journalist [[Avi Lewis]].

Klein spoke at The 3rd annual [[Dalton Camp|Dalton K. Camp]] Lecture in Journalism on [[October 28]], 2004 at [[Saint Thomas University]] in [[Fredericton, New Brunswick]]. 

She also spoke at the 10th Anniversary celebration of [[Stauffer Library]] at [[Queen's University]], [[Kingston, Ontario]] on [[November 4]], 2004 and the Navigating A New World Conference hosted by [[Random House]] of Canada along with [[Lloyd Axworthy]], [[Linda McQuaig]], [[Rom√©o Dallaire]], [[Thomas Homer-Dixon]], and [[Irshad Manji]] on [[November 6]], 2004 at the [[University of Toronto]] in [[Toronto, Ontario]].

In 2004 Klein and Lewis released a [[documentary]] called ''[[The Take]]'', which profiled a group of [[layoff|laid off]] auto-parts workers in [[Argentina]] who took back control of their plant and turned it into a [[cooperative]].
