'''Naomi Klein''' (born May 5, 1970&lt;ref&gt;Date of birth [http://www.fullspectrumottawa.com/authors/naomi_klein.php]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Canadian]] [[journalist]], [[author]] and [[Activism|activist]]. She was born into a political family in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], and now lives in [[Toronto]] with her husband [[Avi Lewis]]. 

Her grandfather was fired for [[labour movement|labor]] organizing at [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] in the [[United States]]. Her father Michael, a physician, was a [[Vietnam War]] resister ([[draft dodger]]) who fled to [[Canada]] and became a member of [[Physicians for Social Responsibility]]. Her film-maker mother, Bonnie, won fame with her [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography]] film, ''Not a Love Story''&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Klein movie: ''[http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC30folder/NotLoveStory.html Not a love story]''&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Her brother Seth is director of the [[Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives]]. Klein's writing career started early with contributions to ''[[The Varsity (newspaper)|The Varsity]]'', a [[University of Toronto]] student newspaper. She served as editor-in-chief of the newspaper. She credits her wake-up call to [[feminism]] as the [[1989]] [[École Polytechnique massacre]] of female engineering students.

Klein left university without taking a degree, deciding to pursue a career as a journalist. She wrote for [[This Magazine]] and reported on the 1993 Canadian federal elections for [[MuchMusic]]. It was in this latter role that she first met and interviewed the man who became her husband.  [[Avi Lewis]] is a television journalist who, like Klein, comes from a political activist background, as the son of Canada's former ambassador to the [[United Nations]] [[Stephen Lewis]] (and until 2006 [[United Nations]] [[special envoy]] for [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] in [[Africa]]) and [[Michele Landsberg]], a journalist. 

Klein became the editor of THIS Magazine and then weekly columnist for the [[Toronto Star]]. It was during this time that she began work on ''[[No Logo]]''.

In [[2000]], Klein published the book ''No Logo'', which for many became a [[manifesto]] of the [[anti-globalization movement]]. This movement had shut down the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO Meeting of 1999]] one month before the release of ''No Logo''. The book lambasts [[brand name|brand]]-oriented [[consumer culture]] by describing the operations of large [[corporation]]s. Their products, she argues, turn people into walking billboards. These corporations are also often guilty of exploiting workers in the world's poorest countries in pursuit of ever-greater profits, she writes. Klein criticized [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] so much in the book that it became one of the first publications to receive feedback from the company.

In [[2002]] Klein published ''Fences and Windows'', a collection of articles and speeches she had written on behalf of the anti-[[globalization]] movement (all proceeds from the book go to benefit activist organizations through The Fences and Windows Fund). Klein also contributes to ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', ''[[In These Times]]'', [[Canada]]'s ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', ''[[This Magazine]]'', and ''[[The Guardian]]''. 

She has continued to write on various current issues, such as the [[occupation of Iraq|war in Iraq]]. In a September 2004 article for ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' entitled "Baghdad Year Zero: Pillaging Iraq in pursuit of a [[neoconservative|neocon]] [[utopia]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harpers.org/BaghdadYearZero.html Baghdad Year Zero]&lt;/ref&gt;, she argues that, contrary to popular belief and criticisms, the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] did have a clear plan for post-invasion Iraq, which was to build a fully unconstrained [[free market economics|free market economy]]. She describes plans to allow foreigners to extract wealth from Iraq, and the methods used to achieve those goals.

Also in 2004, Klein and her husband released a [[documentary film]] called ''[[The Take]]'', which profiled a group of former employees of a bankrupt foundry in [[Argentina]].  The workers took over the closed plant and resumed production, operating as a [[collective]]. The first African screening was in the Kennedy Road shack settlement in the South African city of [[Durban]] where the [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] movement began.

In October 2005, Klein was ranked 11th in the [[The 2005 Global Intellectuals Poll]], a list of the world's top 100 public intellectuals compiled by ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]'' magazine [http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/intellectuals/results] in conjunction with ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine. She was the highest ranked woman on the list. However, Prospect based the list and its rankings entirely on an Internet poll, and explicitly noted that the voters showed a heavy sampling bias toward young North Americans, and that the voting was dominated by active campaigning on the Internet by partisans for particular candidates, in some cases instigated by the candidates themselves.

Naomi Klein's third book, ''The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism'', is currently scheduled for publication in September 2007.
