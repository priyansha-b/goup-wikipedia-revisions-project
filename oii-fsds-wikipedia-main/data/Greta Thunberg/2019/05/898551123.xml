'''Greta Thunberg'''{{efn|{{IPA-sv|²ɡreːta ²tʉːnbærj|lang|Greta Thunberg.ogg}}}} (born 3 January 2003) is a Swedish schoolgirl who, at age 15, began protesting about the need for immediate action to combat [[climate change]] outside the Swedish parliament and has since become an outspoken [[climate activist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/learning/learning-with-becoming-greta-invisible-girl-to-global-climate-activist-with-bumps-along-the-way.html|title=Learning With: 'Becoming Greta: "Invisible Girl" to Global Climate Activist, With Bumps Along the Way'|last=Proulx|first=Natalie|date=21 February 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=1 May 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jw01"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/11/greta-thunberg-schoolgirl-climate-change-warrior-some-people-can-let-things-go-i-cant |title=Greta Thunberg, schoolgirl climate change warrior: 'Some people can let things go.

She is known for having initiated the [[school strike for climate]] movement that formed in November 2018 and surged globally after the [[2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP24) in December the same year.

At a [[TED (conference)#TEDx|TEDx]] talk in November 2018, Thunberg said she first heard about climate change at the age of eight, but could not understand why so little was being done about it.&lt;ref name="Thunberg_20181212"&gt;{{cite AV media |author-first=Greta |author-last=Thunberg |date=12 December 2018 |title=School strike for climate – save the world by changing the rules |work=TEDxStockholm |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAmmUIEsN9A |access-date=29 January 2019 |time=1:46 |location=Stockholm |publisher=TED |quote=I was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrom, OCD, and selective mutism.

Later on she was diagnosed with [[Asperger syndrome]], [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD), and [[selective mutism]]. She added that selective mutism meant she was speaking only when she needed to and that "now is one of those moments"; and that being on the "spectrum" was an advantage "as almost everything is black or white".&lt;ref name="Thunberg_20181212"/&gt; Thunberg has said: "I feel like I am dying inside if I don't protest".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/sep/01/swedish-15-year-old-cutting-class-to-fight-the-climate-crisis|title=The Swedish 15-year-old who's cutting class to fight the climate crisis|last=Crouch|first=David|date=1 September 2018|work=The Guardian|access-date=12 May 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; She hands out leaflets outside the Swedish parliament that state: "I am doing this because you adults are shitting on my future."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Thunberg says her teachers are divided in their views about her missing class to make her point. She says: "As people they think what I am doing is good, but as teachers they say I should stop."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One teacher who supports her said: "Greta is a troublemaker, she is not listening to adults. But we are heading full speed for a catastrophe, and in this situation the only reasonable thing is to be unreasonable."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On 20 August 2018, Thunberg, who had just started ninth grade, decided to not attend school until the [[Swedish general election, 2018|2018 Sweden general election]] on 9 September after [[2018 European heat wave|heat waves]] and [[2018 Sweden wildfires|wildfires]] in Sweden.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her demands were that the Swedish government reduce carbon emissions in accordance with the [[Paris Agreement]], and she protested by sitting outside the [[Riksdag]] every day during school hours with the sign ''Skolstrejk för klimatet'' (school strike for the climate).&lt;ref name="Newyorker1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-fifteen-year-old-climate-activist-who-is-demanding-a-new-kind-of-politics |title=The Fifteen-Year-Old Climate Activist Who Is Demanding a New Kind of Politics |date=2 October 2018 |newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the general elections, she continued to strike only on Fridays, gaining worldwide attention. She inspired school students across the globe to take part in student strikes.&lt;ref name="Guardian2"&gt;{{Cite news |author-first=Damian |author-last=Carrington |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/04/leaders-like-children-school-strike-founder-greta-thunberg-tells-un-climate-summit |title='Our leaders are like children', school strike founder tells climate summit |date=4 December 2018 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2018, more than 20,000 students had held strikes in at least 270 cities.&lt;ref name="Guardian2"/&gt; The idea of having a school strike for climate just before the Swedish parliamentary election was presented by Bo Thorén during a series of meetings on how to mobilise youth on climate change. Thunberg attended a few of those meetings together with other youths and adults. Thorén was in turn inspired by [[Arne Duncan]]'s idea of a school boycott for stricter gun laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=125&amp;artikel=7127615|title=Dalslänning bakom Greta Thunbergs skolstrejk – P4 Väst|date=|website=sverigesradio.se|language=sv|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=12 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodthingsguy.com/opinion/greta-thunberg/|title=Greta Thunberg: School strike for climate and to save the world!|date=5 May 2019|website=Good Things Guy|language=en-ZA|access-date=12 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/05/arne-duncan-boycott-school/560921/|title=Arne Duncan Is Serious: Americans Should Boycott School|last=Harris|first=Adam|date=22 May 2018|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=12 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teen activists at [[Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School]] in [[Parkland, Florida]], who organized the [[March For Our Lives]], was also a source of inspiration for Thunberg to begin her school climate strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Teen activist on climate change: If we don't do anything right now, we're screwed |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGmBkIUwYkA |access-date=10 February 2019 |agency=[[CNN]] |date=23 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Guardian view on teenage activists: protesters not puppets – Editorial |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/07/the-guardian-view-on-teenage-activists-look-whos-pulling-the-strings |access-date=11 February 2019 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=7 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her personal [[manifesto]], Thunberg says she is not a climate scientist herself: She is  merely a messenger who is repeating what scientists have been communicating to the public for decades, so far without much success. She says students would no longer have to leave school to protest if the public only started listening to scientists, but that the current political situation does not work this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/02/03/response-lies-and-hate-let-me-make-some-things-clear-about-my-climate-strike |title=In Response to Lies and Hate, Let Me Make Some Things Clear About My Climate Strike |last=Thunberg |first=Greta |date=3 February 2019 |website=Common Dreams |access-date=22 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From October 2018 onwards, Thunberg's activism evolved from solitary protesting to taking part in demonstrations throughout Europe; making several high profile public speeches; and mobilising her growing number of followers on [[social media]] platforms. However, by March 2019 she still stages her regular protests outside the Swedish parliament every Friday, where other students now occasionally join her. Her activism has not interfered with her schoolwork, but she has had less spare time.&lt;ref name="jw01"/&gt;

[[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN General Secretary]] [[António Guterres]] has endorsed the school strikes initiated by Thunberg, admitting that "My generation has failed to respond properly to the dramatic challenge of climate change. This is deeply felt by young people. No wonder they are angry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/15/climate-strikers-urgency-un-summit-world-leaders |title=The climate strikers should inspire us all to act at the next UN summit |date=15 March 2019 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=18 March 2019 |author-link=António Guterres |author-first=António |author-last=Guterres}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public demonstrations ===
Greta Thunberg participated in the Rise for Climate demonstration outside the [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]]. In [[London]] in October 2018, she addressed the 'Declaration of Rebellion' organized by [[Extinction Rebellion]] opposite the [[Houses of Parliament]]. She said: "We're facing an immediate unprecedented crisis that has never been treated as a crisis and our leaders are all acting like children.

On 24 November 2018, she spoke at TEDxStockholm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TEDxStockholm Theme: Wonderland |url=https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/31825 |publisher=TED |access-date=20 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author-first=Jon |author-last=Queally |title=Depressed and Then Diagnosed With Autism, Greta Thunberg Explains Why Hope Cannot Save Planet But Bold Climate Action Still Can |url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/12/19/depressed-and-then-diagnosed-autism-greta-thunberg-explains-why-hope-cannot-save |publisher=Common Dreams |access-date=20 December 2018 |date=19 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thunberg_20181212"/&gt; She spoke about realising, when she was eight years old, that [[global warming|climate change]] existed and wondering why it was not headline news on every channel, as if there was a world war going on. She said she did not go to school to become a climate scientist, as some suggested, because the science was done and only denial, ignorance and inaction remained. Speculating that her children and grandchildren would ask her why they had not taken action in 2018 when there was still time, she concluded with "we can’t change the world by playing by the rules, because the rules have to be changed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author-last=Jones |author-first=Nigel |title=Why we all need to be more like Greta |url=https://medium.com/nine-by-five-media/why-we-all-need-to-be-more-like-greta-ba36abec961 |access-date=15 February 2019 |work=Nine by Five Media |publisher=Medium |date=30 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the week, she warned the global leaders that "I don't want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day. And then I want you to act.

In that time, unprecedented changes in all aspects of society need to have taken place, including a reduction of our [[carbon dioxide|{{CO2}}]] emissions by at least 50%". &lt;ref name="Our house is on fire"&gt;{{cite news |last=Thunberg|first=Greta|title='Our house is on fire': Greta Thunberg, 16, urges leaders to act on climate|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/25/our-house-is-on-fire-greta-thunberg16-urges-leaders-to-act-on-climate |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=25 January 2019|access-date=14 February 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Economic &amp; Social Committee ===
On 21 February 2019, she spoke at a conference of the [[European Economic and Social Committee]] and to [[European Commission]] chief [[Jean-Claude Juncker]], where she said that to limit global warming to less than the two degrees C goal established at the [[Paris climate accord]], the [[EU]] must reduce their [[carbon dioxide|{{CO2}}]] emissions by 80% by 2030, double the 40% goal set in Paris. "If we fail to do so" she said, "all that will remain of our political leaders' legacy will be the greatest failure of human history." Later, she joined 7,500 Belgian student in a climate protest in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author-last=Carmichael |author-first=Lachlan |title=Climate activist Thunberg urges EU to double carbon reduction targets |url=https://news.yahoo.com/climate-activist-thunberg-urges-eu-double-carbon-reduction-111042030.html |access-date=22 February 2019 |work=news.yahoo.com |date=21 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Swedish teen leads Belgian students on 7th climate march |work=[[Miami Herald]]|agency=[[The Associated Press]] |date=21 February 2019 |url=https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/article226559019.html |access-date=22 February 2019 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190222204457/https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/article226559019.html |archive-date=22 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Berlin ===
In the weekend 29–31 March, Thunberg visited Berlin. She spoke in front of some 25,000 people near the [[Brandenburg Gate]] on Friday, where she argued that "We live in a strange world where children must sacrifice their own education in order to protest against the destruction of their future. Where the people who have contributed the least to this crisis are the ones who are going to be affected the most."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pressenza.com/2019/03/fridays-for-future-25000-demonstrate-in-berlin-with-greta-thunberg/ |title=Fridays for the Future: 25,000 demonstrate in Berlin with Greta Thunberg |author-last=Thumiger |author-first=Reto |date=31 March 2019 |website=Pressenza |access-date=5 April 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the speech, Thunberg and fellow climate activist {{ill|Luisa Neubauer|de}} visited the [[Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research]] and met with scientists there. On Saturday, Thunberg received the [[Goldene Kamera|'Golden Camera']] Special Award on Germany's annual film and television award show. In her acceptance speech at the gala, Thunberg urged celebrities everywhere to use their influence and do their fair share of climate activism to help her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/greta-thunberg-joins-german-students-climate-protest-berlin |title=Greta Thunberg joins German students for climate protest in Berlin |author-last1=Waldholz |author-first1=Rachel |author-last2=Wehrmann |author-first2=Benjamin |date=29 March 2019 |website=Clean Energy Wire |access-date=5 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="el01"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.plantbasednews.org/post/greta-thunberg-celebrities-face-climate-crisis |title=Greta Thunberg Calls Out Celebrities To Face Climate Crisis In Powerful Speech |author-last=Gilliver |author-first=Liam  |date=4 April 2019 |website=Plant Based News |access-date=12 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== EU leaders ===
At an April 2019 meeting at the [[European Parliament]] in Strasbourg with MEP's and EU officials, she chided those present "for three emergency Brexit summits and no emergency summit regarding the breakdown of the climate and the environment". Climate change discussions have not been dominant at EU summits because other issues have taken precedence.&lt;ref name="Rankin"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rankin|first=Jennifer|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/16/greta-thunberg-urges-eu-leaders-wake-up-climate-change-school-strike-movement|title=Forget Brexit and focus on climate change, Greta Thunberg tells EU|work=The Guardian|date=16 April 2019|access-date=24 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued: "The extinction rate is up to 10,000 times faster than what is considered normal, with up to 200 species becoming extinct every single day". In addition, the "[e]rosion of fertile topsoil, deforestation of the rainforest, toxic air pollution, loss of insects and wildlife, acidification of our oceans ... are all disastrous trends." Thunberg was given a 30-second standing ovation at the end of her speech.&lt;ref name="Rankin" /&gt;

== Prizes and awards ==
Greta Thunberg was one of the winners of [[Svenska Dagbladet]]'s debate article writing competition on the climate for young people in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.svd.se/vi-vet--och-vi-kan-gora-nagot-nu |title="Vi vet – och vi kan göra något nu" |website=SvD.se |language=sv |access-date=22 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunberg was nominated for the electricity company Telge Energi's prize for children and young people who promote sustainable development, ''Children's Climate Prize,'' but declined because the finalists would have to fly to Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.etc.se/klimat/darfor-nobbar-greta-thunberg-klimatpriset |title=Därför nobbar Greta Thunberg klimatpriset |author-last=Gelin |author-first=Gustav |date=1 November 2018 |website=ETC |language=sv |access-date=22 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2018, she was awarded the [[Fryshuset]] scholarship of the Young Role Model of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.aktuellhallbarhet.se/greta-thunberg-blir-arets-unga-forebild/ |title=Greta Thunberg blir Årets unga förebild |date=22 November 2018 |website=Aktuell Hållbarhet |language=sv-SE |access-date=22 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2018, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named Thunberg one of the world's 25 most influential teenagers of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://time.com/5463721/most-influential-teens-2018/ |title=TIME's 25 Most Influential Teens of 2018 |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=22 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the occasion of [[International Women's Day]] Thunberg was proclaimed the [[Swedish Woman of the Year|most important woman of the year in Sweden]] in 2019. The award was based on a survey by the institute ''Inizio'' on behalf of the newspaper ''[[Aftonbladet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Schulstreik fürs Klima – Klimaaktivistin Greta Thunberg in Schweden "Frau des Jahres"|language=de |author=dpa |journal=[[Zeit Online]] |date=8 March 2019 |url=https://www.zeit.de/news/2019-03/08/klimaaktivistin-greta-thunberg-in-schweden-frau-des-jahres-190308-99-297313 |access-date=8 March 2019 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190309164608/https://www.zeit.de/news/2019-03/08/klimaaktivistin-greta-thunberg-in-schweden-frau-des-jahres-190308-99-297313 |archive-date=8 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 March 2019, she received the German [[Goldene Kamera]] Special Climate Protection award.&lt;ref name="Goldene Kamera"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Greta Thunberg wird mit der GOLDENEN KAMERA 2019 ausgezeichnet |trans-title=Greta Thunberg is awarded the GOLDEN CAMERA 2019 |publisher=[[Goldene Kamera]] |date=18 March 2019 |language=de |url=https://www.goldenekamera.de/preisverleihung/nominierte-preistraeger-2019/article216694793/Greta-Thunberg-wird-mit-der-GOLDENEN-KAMERA-2019-ausgezeichnet.html |access-date=31 March 2019 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331123607/https://www.goldenekamera.de/preisverleihung/nominierte-preistraeger-2019/article216694793/Greta-Thunberg-wird-mit-der-GOLDENEN-KAMERA-2019-ausgezeichnet.html |archive-date=31 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Verleihung der Goldenen Kamera Erst Klimaaktivistin geehrt, dann SUV verschenkt – Erst bekommt Greta Thunberg die "Goldene Kamera".

On 13 March 2019, three members of the [[Storting|Norwegian parliament]] nominated Thunberg as a candidate for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. The nominating politicians explained their decision by arguing that [[global warming]] will be the cause of "wars, conflict and refugees" if nothing is done to halt it. Thunberg responded that she was "honoured and very grateful" for the nomination.&lt;ref name="av01"/&gt; If Thunberg receives the Prize later this year, she will become the youngest person ever to receive it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ecowatch.com/greta-thunberg-nobel-peace-prize-2631637803.html?rebelltitem=6#rebelltitem6 |title=Greta Thunberg—Swedish Teen who Inspired School Climate Strikes—Nominated for Nobel Peace Prize |author-last=Rosane |author-first=Olivia |date=14 March 2019 |newspaper=EcoWatch |access-date=22 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2019, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named Greta Thunberg as one of the 100 most influential people of 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author-last=González |author-first=Emma |title=Greta Thunberg |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2019/5567758/greta-thunberg |access-date=18 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, the Chilean-based organization Fundación Milarepa para el Diálogo con Asia, headed by [[Mario Aguilar]] of the [[University of St Andrews]], announced that Thunberg had been selected as the recipient of the organization's [[Laudato Si' Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Greta Thunberg Winner of the Laudato Si' Prize 2019! |author-first=Fundación |author-last=Milarepa |date=19 April 2019 |newspaper=FundaciónMilarepa |url=https://fundacionmilarepachile.org/2019/04/19/greta-thunberg-winner-of-the-laudato-si-prize-2019/ |access-date=20 April 2019 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190420170424/https://fundacionmilarepachile.org/2019/04/19/greta-thunberg-winner-of-the-laudato-si-prize-2019/ |archive-date=20 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Backlash and controversy ==
=== Media criticism ===

Writing for ''[[Quillette]]'' magazine, Swedish journalist {{ill|Paulina Neuding|sv}} questioned whether the fame and attention that Thunberg has received puts excessive pressure on her. Neuding wondered if this could be a problem considering her multiple mental diagnoses by claiming that "a school strike... constitutes a form of self-harm, undertaken to attract adult attention... Given what we know about Greta’s problems and challenges, is this (attention) an appropriate adult response to Greta’s school strike?"&lt;ref name="Quillette"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Neuding |first1=Paulina |title=Self-Harm Versus the Greater Good: Greta Thunberg and Child Activism |url=https://quillette.com/2019/04/23/self-harm-versus-the-greater-good-greta-thunberg-and-child-activism/ |website=Quillette |accessdate=25 April 2019 |language=en-AU |date=23 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Helen Dale]], who also writes for Quillette, posted a tweet calling for Thunberg to be interviewed by the BBC's [[Andrew Neil]], a climate denialist. Dale suggested "she may even have a meltdown on national telly” and said "we'll never hear from her again". After she was criticised for her tweet, Dale claimed the tweet "was, fairly obviously, a joke". Despite the extremely polarized reaction it received, she maintained her criticism of Thunberg as an advocate for climate-change awareness, arguing that children "cannot ‘lead’ us".&lt;ref name="Spectator"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dale |first1=Helen |title=Greta Thunberg’s supporters can’t have it both ways |url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/04/greta-thunbergs-supporters-cant-have-it-both-ways/ |accessdate=30 April 2019 |work=Spectator |date=29 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, speaking at an event in [[New Zealand]] in May 2019, UN Secretary-General [[Antonio Guterres]] said his generation was "not winning the battle against climate change" and that it's up to youth to "rescue the planet".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&amp;objectid=12230530 UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says his generation should have done more on climate change], NZ Herald,13 May 2019 &lt;/ref&gt;

In the run up to European elections May 2019, rightwing populists in Germany increased their attacks on climate science, and began targeting Thunberg in their messaging. Germany’s [[Alternative for Germany|AfD]], which embraces climate change denial, also makes personal attacks on Thunberg ridiculing her as “mentally challenged” and a fraud. Jakob Guhl, a researcher for the [[Institute for Strategic Dialogue]], said climate change denial was part of the party’s political platform, and that "attacking Greta, at times in fairly vicious ways, including mocking her for her autism, became a way to portray the AfD’s political opponents as irrational.”&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/14/germanys-afd-attacks-greta-thunberg-as-it-embraces-climate-denial Germany’s AfD turns on Greta Thunberg as it embraces climate denial,] The Guardian, 14 May, 2019&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media support ===

After Thunberg's student climate strikes gained momentum, [[climate change denier]]s attempted to discredit her.&lt;ref name="Vice-GWPF"&gt;{{cite news |author-last=Sandler Clarke |author-first=Joe |title=The Climate Change Deniers Trying to Discredit Greta Thunberg |url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/mbzg8q/the-climate-change-deniers-trying-to-discredit-greta-thunberg |work=Vice |date=7 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', Aditya Chakrabortty notes that eco-denialists have begun resorting to "ugly personal attacks" on Thunberg.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/01/greta-thunberg-right-environmental-activist-attacks The hounding of Greta Thunberg is proof that the right has run out of ideas,] The Guardian 1 May 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other media commentators have supported Thunberg. Also in ''The Guardian'', Charlie Hancock wrote: "The attacks on (Thunberg) from neurotypical critics are glib and spiteful. But they are a tribute to the power of her arguments."&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/25/greta-thunberg-autism-spectrum-critics Like Greta Thunberg, I am on the autism spectrum. She gives me hope,] The Guardian, 25 April 2019,&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'', [[Steve Silberman]] praised Thunberg's advocacy, pointing out that being on the [[autism]] spectrum provides her with the ability to be obsessive and quite blunt in her views.&lt;ref name="Vox"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Silberman |first1=Steve |title=Greta Thunberg became a climate activist not in spite of her autism, but because of it |url=https://www.vox.com/first-person/2019/5/6/18531551/autism-greta-thunberg-speech |website=Vox |accessdate=7 May 2019 |date=6 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Packham]], the ''[[Springwatch]]'' presenter who also has Asperger's made a similar point about Thunberg's demeanor. He says "People like me with Asperger's syndrome are not affected by this sort of thing. It doesn't weaken our resolve. We've seen it this week with the trolling of Greta. It's a complete waste of time."&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Barkham |first1=Patrick |title=Chris Packham defiant after activists leave dead crows at his home |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/25/dead-crows-left-at-chris-packhams-home-in-row-over-killing-pest-birds |accessdate=28 April 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=25 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an article headlined ''Why They're Really Scared Of Greta Thunberg'', ''[[Huffington Post]]'' argues that Thunberg "frighten(s) the life out of a particular middle-aged and middle-class establishment type of person...  and that the reaction to her is driven by the fear of knowing that losing their place to her and those like her (in political conversation) is inevitable."&lt;ref name="HuffPost"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Grant |first1=Alan |title=Why They're Really Scared Of Greta Thunberg |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/greta-thunberg_uk_5cc2c77de4b00dceee75a8ca |accessdate=28 April 2019 |work=HuffPost UK |date=26 April 2019 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2019, Thunberg featured on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine where she was described as a role model&lt;ref&gt;[http://time.com/collection-post/5584902/greta-thunberg-next-generation-leaders/?utm_medium=socialflowtw&amp;utm_campaign=time&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;xid=time_socialflow_twitter ‘Now I Am Speaking to the Whole World.’ How Teen Climate Activist Greta Thunberg Got Everyone to Listen,] Time 16 May 2019 &lt;/ref&gt; and one of the "next generation leaders".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.plantbasednews.org/post/greta-thunberg-cover-time Greta Thunberg On The Cover Of TIME: "Now I Am Speaking to the Whole World",] Plant Based News, 16 May 2019 &lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with Suyin Haynes, she addressed the criticism she's received online saying: "It's quite hilarious when the only thing people can do is mock you, or talk about your appearance or personality, as it means they have no argument or nothing else to say."&lt;ref&gt;[http://time.com/collection-post/5584902/greta-thunberg-next-generation-leaders/?utm_medium=socialflowtw&amp;utm_campaign=time&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;xid=time_socialflow_twitter ‘Now I Am Speaking to the Whole World.’ How Teen Climate Activist Greta Thunberg Got Everyone to Listen,] Time 16 May 2019 &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Misuse of her name ===

Some people have tried to benefit from Thunberg's high profile without her consent.&lt;ref name="Politico-Feb12"&gt;{{cite news |author-last=Oroschakoff |author-first=Kalina |title=Teen climate icon used for fundraising without her knowledge |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/greta-thunberg-teen-climate-icon-used-for-fundraising-without-her-knowledge/ |work=Politico-EU |date=February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2018, Ingmar Rentzhog, founder of the non-profit We Don't Have Time Foundation (WDHT), recruited Thunberg to become an unpaid youth advisor and used Thunberg's name and image without her knowledge or permission to raise millions for WDHT's for-profit subsidiary We Don't Have Time AB, of which Rentzhog is CEO.
